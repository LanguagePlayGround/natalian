I wrote a crappy [script](http://video.natalian.org/my-tube.txt) to generate
the HTML to view those [OGGs I have been
amassing](http://svn.natalian.org/projects/static/prep-videos.sh) from my Canon
IXUS over the years.

I kind of feel I am with video, like I was with pictures & images about 5 years
ago. Pre-[Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/). _You know what I
mean?_ No search, no tags and no friends (filtering dude!).

It would be great if I could point a service like
[Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/) all my OGG paths on
<http://static.natalian.org/>. I am sure as hell not going to upload those
videos with their [crappy upload interface](http://www.flickr.com/photos/upload/).

Gosh, I hope you'll enjoy <http://video.natalian.org> better than [my YouTube
account](http://www.youtube.com/user/kaihendry).

<http://static.natalian.org> should be served from the closest one of two
servers, one based in California and the other in Germany. They [GEO DNS setup
is described at
Serverfault](http://serverfault.com/questions/30567/geo-dns-providers/42889#42889).
