It's funny that I've never heard you complaining when the BBC reports on IE security flaws. Maybe the BBC thought that they should be impartial, as is their remit. What annoyed me was the \"expert\" saying that you shouldn't change your browser \"willy-nilly\", this sounds like an excellent idea to me, you would effectively be a moving target for the miscreants. Agree with you about the occasional advertising though. I think that complaints made to the BBC are released somewhere, they appear every so often on http://ifyoulikeitsomuchwhydontyougolivethere.com/ eg:

Sound familiar? In fact, did you write the Woman's Hour one? :)
