My consumer mission of late was to get a pair of **quality** sunglasses or
"sunnies" as we like to call them. Luckily enough an Italian friend from
[Pescara](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/sets/72157605644214407/), I met
via [Erasmus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus_Programme) in Helsinki,
recommended [Maui Jim](http://www.mauijim.com) glasses.

Why? She says they use the best Polaroid technology and lenses that her
employer's <http://www.barberini.eu> manufacture. The best sun glasses are made
of glass. She adds:

	Concerning the main brand, I'll suggest you Maui Jim's sunglasses as they
	are made with the best glass lenses. They have a special patent. They are not
	very commercial and popular expecially in Europe, but they are the best. Try
	them and you will see the difference.  You can also have a look if you like
	Revo or Rayban and maybe Persol. You always have to ask for polarized lenses.
	If you prefer plycarbonate lenses, you can ask for the trendy and fashion
	Oakley!

Whilst I was on a business trip in San Francisco I went to a premier dealer and
found such a pair. If you compare them to plastic glasses, the difference is
amazing. I bought curved glasses as I do a lot of riding and didn't want my
eyes to tear. However I am a little worried about falling off my bike and
cracking my glasses now. I was also advised to be very careful if I get salt
water on them. Worst you can do is wipe them clean with salt on the lens, as it
will scratch them.

So they need a bit of extra care, though I'm really enjoying the quality vision
in sunlight.
