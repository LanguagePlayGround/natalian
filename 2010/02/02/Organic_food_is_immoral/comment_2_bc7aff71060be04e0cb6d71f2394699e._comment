Firstly the [worst offender described by the Soil Association](http://www.soilassociation.org/Whyorganic/Whatisorganic/Fivereasonstochooseorganic/tabid/334/Default.aspx) is [nitrogen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen)!

Also if you supported scientific GM food advancements where crops are typically engineered to become disease/pest/drought resistant, farmers could reduce the need for \"chemicals\" and pesticides.


Your second argument about UK surplus is alarming. Are we are so rich we can afford to have poor yields? Are we so rich we can afford to be wasteful? Many countries in this world rely on foreign food imports.
