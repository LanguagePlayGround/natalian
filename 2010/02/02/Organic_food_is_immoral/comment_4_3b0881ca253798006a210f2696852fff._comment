The reason why I understand that GM crops are \"crippled by design\", i.e. do not seed is primarily so they do not reproduce and spread like wildfire. It's a **sensible protection mechanism**.

Despite our best intentions when we have introduced new plants or animals, things can go wrong. I think of Australia and its outbreaks of rabbits and what not as an example.

Hence I think this precautionary approach of GM food is fine and I prefer it over something they can ravage the world like some grey goo. Critics argue all the power goes to the \"multinational agricultural biotechnology corporations\". Oh pretty please. I guess the same people have no problem with Apple or Google or Microsoft.

Plus I prefer my citrus fruit without pips. Don't you?

Btw I don't think Britain is \"tiny\". West Sussex exports grain. I support technology to improve our productivity.
