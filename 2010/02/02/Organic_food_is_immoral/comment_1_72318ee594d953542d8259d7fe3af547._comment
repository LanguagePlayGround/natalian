You've completely ignored exactly 50% of their two points. Can you argue that oragnic food is not better for the environment? How can it not be with chemicals not entering the soil/food chain.

Also, I'm not sure the amount of food produced in the UK is that important, we have a surplus here and surely don't contribute much to the world supply.
