The gas shouldn't expire in 10 years, my parents home is closing in on 20 and are not even close. I've also heard that double windows are just as effective, or more so, but that is not my own personal impression, I also believe window technology has become better the last 10-20 years, so this surely can'te be true today. Nobody builds new houses with double windows in Norway today, but be do build so called \"passive housing\", meaning they shouldn't need more than body heat and waste heat for heating.

I'm pretty sure Dealextreme.com has watt meters, I've used one myself sucessfully. X10 is a long time \"home control\" system thingie for controlling your electronic devices around the house.
