The NHS tests for wheat intolerance using blood antibody tests.

Having a family history of gluten intolerance, and a medical condition that can be caused or aggravated (the science is unclear) by gluten intolerance, my GP was happy to order the tests on the NHS.

The relevant lab tests are well established, and you can get detailed figures for how well they corroborate with biopsy results. They aren't perfect, but pretty reliable, and one can usually avoid an unpleasant biopsy.

I had you down as probably hyperthyroid or maybe adrenal or other endocrine dysfunction -- but you don't say what symptoms are leading to this test.
