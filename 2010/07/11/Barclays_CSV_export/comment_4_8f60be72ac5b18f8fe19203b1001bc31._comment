I'm having the same problem with Barclays, it is an absolute joke, you're right, only 60 days backwards?!?! 
I like the comparison with only having 60 emails, hahahaha, very accurate tho!
In other words, I'll be closing my Barclays BUSINESS account very shortly.  My personal natwest account and for that matter every other account I've ever had lets me download to my hearts content.  
STAY AWAY FROM BARCLAYS
