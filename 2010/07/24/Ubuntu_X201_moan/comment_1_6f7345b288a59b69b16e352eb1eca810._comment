The things you mention are annoying, but if you don't want gnome and use a tiling wm then why not install Arch linux? My idle memory usage went from 23% to 3% and load average from something near 1.00 to near zero. Ubuntu  put a lot of effort into parallelising start up for a faster boot, but if you don't start tens of unnecessary services you get a fast boot anyway.
