<p>I read the results of a test done by the European broadcasting union about whether people can make out the difference between standard and hdtv resolution content when screen size is increased (as it has been doing for quite a while) and the conclusion was a resounding yes. I didn&#8217;t find the paper right now, so I can&#8217;t give the link or anything exact, but I&#8217;d recall people with screens that very bigger than 30&#8221; started to prefer HD strongly over <span class="caps">STD</span>.</p>

<p>Like the wikipedia article for hdtv says, there are several high res modes, and in the <span class="caps">EBU</span> test the highest res (1920&#215;1080) wasn&#8217;t really preferred with anything less than 60&#8221; sets (as far as I remember). That test was done at a viewing distance of 2/3 meters. Close up there&#8217;s no question of seeing the difference. If you&#8217;ve got quicktime codecs (yes, evil) for mplayer installed you should have no trouble seeing the difference yourself with some HD-trailers on Apple&#8217;s movie trailer site.</p>
