<p>is there any difference between rtsp://rmlivev8.bbc.net.uk/farm/<strong>/ev7/live24/radio5/live/r5_tl_int_g2.ra and rtsp://rmlivev8acl.bbc.net.uk/farm/</strong>/ev7/live24/radio5/live/r5_tl_g2.ra ?<br />
first one is for international, and second one is for uk only.. and mms:// links works both hi and low..</p>

<p>maybe i think uk-only rm only offer live radio stream..right?</p>
