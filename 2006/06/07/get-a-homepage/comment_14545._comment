<p>hcard is a 1:1 mapping of vcard that unlike vcard is <strong>publishable</strong> on the Web.</p>

<p>So with hcard it is super easy to convert the information to a vcard. That&#8217;s pretty much the philosophy behind hcard as I understand it. So you could interchange hcard with vcard. Just as unlikely companies will do it.</p>
