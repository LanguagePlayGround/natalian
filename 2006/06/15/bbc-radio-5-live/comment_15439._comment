<p><span class="caps">OGG</span> stream too slow?</p>

<p>kendalbren: I have the same problem. Seems like the <span class="caps">OGG</span> stream is too slow&#8230; i have tried <span class="caps">VLC</span> and stream through <span class="caps">XBOX</span> media player&#8230; no luck. I have to keep pressing pause on my <span class="caps">DVR</span> to keep in sync with the TV broadcast (ESPN in <span class="caps">USA</span>) ...</p>

<p>any ideas anybody?</p>

<p>great work! <span class="caps">BCC</span> commentary so much better than <span class="caps">ESPN</span>!!</p>
