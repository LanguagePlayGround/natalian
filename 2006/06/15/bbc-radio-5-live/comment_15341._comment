<p>dijares: I&#8217;m just doing UK 5live. It&#8217;s upto them.</p>

<p>kendalbren: As I don&#8217;t have a TV I can&#8217;t determine if this is Realplayer&#8217;s or <span class="caps">OGG</span>&#8216;s fault. If there is some setting for my icecast2 server I&#8217;d gladly apply it.</p>

<p>The trouble with these sort of streams are that they are cached to ensure &#8220;continuous&#8221; playback. I don&#8217;t think it will ever quite compare with FM and what have you.</p>
