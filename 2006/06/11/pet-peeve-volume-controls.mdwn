<p>This annoying problem occurs on Win32 and Linux based platforms.</p>

<p>Problem: <span class="caps">WTF</span> is my sound?</p>

<p>Cause: Some stupid program or device has a volume control which gets inadvertently adjusted affecting playback.</p>

<p>Solution: Don&#8217;t fuck with the master volume control.</p>

<p>Do not put volume control functionality in your program. I beg of you. Current suspects are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Google video</li>
<li>Rhythmbox</li>
<li>Skype</li>
<li><span class="caps">BBC</span>&#8216;S embedded realplayer applet</li>
</ul>
