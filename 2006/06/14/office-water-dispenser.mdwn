<p>I hate offices with water dispensers. It is such a waste.</p>

<p>Why not install a tap? Probably too expensive they say. We&#8217;d rather pay some grunt to deliver huge plastic bottles every few days.</p>

<p>Oh it&#8217;s better water they&#8217;ll say. Install a filter on the tap if you&#8217;re so concerned about the &#8220;taste of water&#8221;.</p>

<p>Another good thing about getting a tap, is that you usually get a sink with it. So people can actually clean their mugs without going to the toilet sink.</p>

<p>Instead we have to use paper cups. Sometimes people are actually too lazy to drain their throw away cup, resulting in spills in the paper waste basket.</p>

<p>I also don&#8217;t like the tacky little dispensing nozzle which is usually really low, so I have to bend down to use it.</p>

<p>I wish someone made me nice cups of Tetley every hour or two. That would be good.</p>
