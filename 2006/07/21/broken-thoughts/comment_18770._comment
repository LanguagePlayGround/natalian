<p>Snapshot worked for me&#8230;.</p>

<p>Because it was X, I ended up reinstalling every package depending on X. But because X is an application that doesn&#8217;t require a reboot or anything silly.</p>

<p>Of course backing out this way is dependent on no irreversable changes to data, but I doubt other vendors do a better job than Debian here. Sure one vendr will restore some types of metadata to their earlier configuration, but it ain&#8217;t intelligent in the way it is done.</p>
