<p>I have a couple if interesting leads.</p>

<p>I recall I transferred money (after begging) from the UK to my Finnish bank account, whilst in Finland at very little cost with&#8230; <span class="caps">VISA</span>. I gave my Barclays <span class="caps">VISA</span> card details to <span class="caps">SAMPO</span> and they debited the cash. Though back then they said it was not policy to do this. The trouble back then is that I had <strong>no money</strong> and waiting for a typical tranfer could take all week!</p>

<p>Jamie suggest Paypal. Hmmm, I&#8217;d rather not.</p>

<p>I did email <span class="caps">SWIFT</span> after I search I found something about bank charges. Unfortunately they are of no help whatsover.</p>
