<p><span class="caps">SAMPO</span> do charge 4,50EUR for a EU transfer. Their system for transferring the money is a bit weird.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t see why they can&#8217;t make it the same style as a normal Finnish transfer. Instead there is an extra confirm stage. Odd.</p>

<p>Initially they say they require:</p>

<p>* the beneficiary´s account number in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBAN" rel="nofollow"><span class="caps">IBAN</span></a> form (International Bank Account Number)<br />
 * the <span class="caps">BIC</span>/SWIFT code of the beneficiary´s bank</p>

<p>They <span class="caps">ALSO</span> require the address of the receiver. Grrr.</p>
