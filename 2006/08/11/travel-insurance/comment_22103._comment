<p>I wrote a long email to my insurer asking further questions:</p>

<p>Am I allowed more than one medical claim?</p>

<p>Can you tell me who (which medical institution) the insurers refer me to<br />
in case of a medical emergency in Beunos Aires? I worry that making that<br />
dreaded call after a stabbing might be difficult.</p>

<p>Am I insured for hunting accidents?</p>

<p>And cycling accidents?</p>

<p>Am I insured from the minute I take my policy out? I am worried about<br />
being mugged in London.</p>

<p>Point 20 concerning any claim in connection with alcohol or drugs seems<br />
to rule out a lot of my holiday. If I am drunk and it&#8217;s not my fault, is<br />
the claim still void? What happens if the bus driver is drunk (or on<br />
drugs) whilst he runs me down? I assume drugs in this case means illegal<br />
drugs? Are legal prescription drugs sourced illegally considered<br />
illegal?</p>

<p>I see point 20 stealthily add STDs, which is a bit mean. Once I caught<br />
something from a hotel bed in Russia. What I contracted had all the<br />
taboo of an <span class="caps">STD</span> except I didn&#8217;t perform anything sordid!</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t understand section F. What will I get of I loose say, my right<br />
leg in a train accident? What&#8217;s that about full time employment? Am I<br />
computer programmer so I don&#8217;t really need my right leg.</p>

<p>Can you cover me for motorcycling? I know this policy doesn&#8217;t. Wondered<br />
if there was one that did.</p>

<p>Can you sell me an insurance that is <span class="caps">ONLY</span> concerned with medical?<br />
<a href="http://natalian.org/archives/2006/08/11/travel-insurance/">http://natalian.org/archives/2006/08/11/travel-insurance/</a> My health is<br />
the only real concern of mine. The other bits of cover are just<br />
ridiculous really.</p>

<p>Scenario: I have caught some sort of bacterial infection in my uterus. I<br />
need to see a doctor and I need to purchase expensive prescription<br />
drugs. Is that covered?  The terms and conditions seem to imply hospital<br />
treatment. Some hospitals are awful and I would rather visit a clinic.</p>

<p>Is kidnapping considered the same as hijacking?</p>

<p>Can I have the international emergency number to give them a trial run?<br />
I am concerned I might get lost in some computer system whilst they try<br />
connect me to an outsourced Bangladeshi operator.</p>

<p>Best wishes,</p>
