<p>Hi Kai!<br />
 Good to know about the travel insurance. Sounds like a real waste of money.  I haven&#8217;t traveled enough to have ever really needeed it, but I hope that I can travel more soon.  I miss seeing you.  Korea is so much more boring without you!!! You have got to visit me next year in the <span class="caps">USA</span>!  I&#8217;ll shpw you American culture. I think that you&#8217;ll find it amusing. Keep in touch! And take care!</p>
