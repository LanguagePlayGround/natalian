<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I live in northern England, and I go to the Daphne du Maurier Festival of Art and Literature, in Fowey (Cornwall) every year. Although it sounds &#8216;arty&#8217; it isn&#8217;t really, being characterised more by rucksacks, laughter, alchohol, and fun. Cornwall has been in my blood, so to speak, for more years than I care to remember.</p>

<p>Having said all that, I&#8217;m fascinated by South America, and can&#8217;t help wondering what a Cornish person is doing so far from home! I gather that Welsh people emigrated to Tierra del Fuego (spelling- sorry!), but your story is intriguing!</p>

<p>Best Wishes from a rain and windswept November UK.</p>

<p>Sam</p>
