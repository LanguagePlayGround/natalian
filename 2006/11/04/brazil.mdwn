<p>In a similar strain to my previous listing about <a href="http://natalian.org/archives/2006/09/05/argentina/">Argentina</a>, I give you my impressions of Brazil. Or is that Brasil?</p>

<ul>
<li>Red earth and very green</li>
<li>Rains more than Argentina, humid, a little hotter. Update: Today SP is a chilly 15C. <span class="caps">WTF</span>.</li>
<li>Bank machines are a nightmare for international <span class="caps">VISA</span> withdrawals. Took me two days to find a machine for my Barclays debit card! Update: Barclays debit does not work at all today. This is <strong>nasty</strong>.</li>
<li>Life is actually a little more relaxed than Argentina. Lots of shops are closed on Saturdays. Ok, I have found a couple of 24hr places now.</li>
<li>Finding a hostel in São Paulo (SP) is not easy either&#8230; (actually finding a hostel you&#8217;ve actually booked)</li>
<li>São Paulo does not feel that polluted as I thought it would be.</li>
<li>Security situation seems to be similar to South Africa</li>
<li>A lot of people have &#8220;domestic help&#8221; aka servants</li>
<li>Socially, quite like India. Lots of street children, though most seem not as friendly&#8230;</li>
<li>Cops and security guards have guns. I really do not want to hear a shot&#8230;</li>
<li>Expensive (like twice the price of Argentina almost)</li>
<li>Can not find an Internet cafe with Skype</li>
<li><span class="caps">EVERYONE</span> <span class="caps">USES</span> <a href="http://www.orkut.com"><span class="caps">ORKUT</span></a></li>
<li>Quite a few Asian people (CJK looking, not Indian). Lots of Asian restaurants to try.</li>
<li>I am not that impressed with the chicas. Cordoba, Argentina is still best. (This Monday around Paulista has been better mind)</li>
<li>People are warm and friendly</li>
<li>I thought phones in Argentina were broken and complicated. Come to Brazil! It is amazingly <span class="caps">WORSE</span> and much more expensive.</li>
<li>People seem to prefer me speaking English than struggling with Spanish. I think it was almost a mistake to learn Spanish and then to try speak Portuguese. It is so strange. Especially the pronunciation.</li>
<li>Metro is really good and safe. Although I am starting to see the limits. Need to understand the buses with the guide, well actually I wish I had a car.</li>
<li>São Paulo is quite hilly is some places, making it a pain to walk or cycle</li>
<li>I hate how finding a public toilet seems near impossible in São Paulo. Seoul, Korea gets this so right.</li>
<li>Brazilian nuts are expensive, should they not be cheaper?</li>
<li>There are some fruits here I have never seen before</li>
<li>There are some plants/animals (birds) here I have never seen before</li>
<li>A lot of people like wearing clothes and even shoes with <span class="caps">BRASIL</span> or <span class="caps">BRAZIL</span> or the flag. Is it just fashion or are they nationalistic?</li>
<li>They prepare the steak / parrilla on these skewers</li>
<li>Coffee tastes quite different. Quite strong (or bitter? or not as roasted?) compared to Argentina.</li>
<li>There is much more boring concrete here in SP than Buenos Aires. At least in Buenos Aires they often try decorate the concrete. SP (around Paulista Avenue) sort of reminds me of how eastern Germany used to be.</li>
<li>Last Sunday, from a balcony in Bela Vista I can hear the Samba schools in the night, that stiffens the hair on the back of my neck</li>
<li>Just as noisy as Buenos Aires. Streets are a little wider in general which does help mind.</li>
<li>Books are so expensive! One of those countries where I simply can not find a public library to lend books.</li>
<li>One of those countries like Argentina were you have to throw toilet paper away in a bin. I hate that.</li>
<li>There seems to be a large black/white racial mix in Brasil. I have never quite seen this elsewere.</li>
<li>More places than Argentina with air conditioning. Thankfully!</li>
<li>Internet seems slow and pricey. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> is especially b0rked. My friend said today he expected me on some tropical island with fast Internet. <span class="caps">WTF</span> is that tropical Island I dare ask?</li>
<li>I feel quite safe walking around. Not carrying my backpack, much cash or my camera mind, and I am sticking to the busy streets. Brazilians told me of some crazy incidents where the entire SP city has be held hostage to criminals (3 times in one year?). Charming.</li>
<li>Being a pedestrian and crossing roads has its challenges to say the least. The sidewalks could be better.</li>
<li>Medical services seem outrageously expensive. 200 reals for a <span class="caps">CONSULTATION</span> for my friend with a punctured eye. <span class="caps">OMG</span>.</li>
<li>Co-incidentally everyone I meet seems to be into Architecture. Good architecture in my opinion is a roomy private toilet.</li>
<li>I have the feeling that there seems to be a little more openly gay people here. That&#8217;s cool.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ok, I am finished with this. I received an excellent piece of an advice regarding the showers. Wear flip-flops (Australians call these thongs) in the shower. You avoid both athletes foot and an electric shock this way.</p>
