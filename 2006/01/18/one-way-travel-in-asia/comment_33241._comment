<p>Hey,</p>

<p>I am traveling to South Korea in about two weeks to visit my girlfriend. I also bought a one way ticket with Air korea because it was so much cheeper and I do not know how long I will be staying. A few months I assume. However I now learned that I may be turned down upon landing because I do not have a return date planned or pre purchased.</p>

<p>Does anyone know if it is true that I must have a return ticket before landing?</p>

<p>Thanks.<br />
Steve</p>
