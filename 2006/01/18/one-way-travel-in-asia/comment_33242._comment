<p>I remember not being allowed to board a Bangladesh flight to Tokyo from Bangkok, because I only had a one way ticket.</p>

<p>I think it is up to the airline and a bit of luck. They usually if you consult your local Korean Embassy and get a tourist visa in advance, then you&#8217;re likely to avoid disappointment.</p>

<p>Usual disclaimers apply. I&#8217;m no expert, but I&#8217;ve been there! :)</p>
