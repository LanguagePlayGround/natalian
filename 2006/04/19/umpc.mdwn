<p>The <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/microsoft_origami_too_revolutionary.php">origami launch hilariously bombed</a> for Samsung and Microsoft.</p>

<p>1300USD is a crazy price. You can easily find a X40 for 1400USD in Seoul right now. Perhaps cheaper. What would you rather have?!</p>

<p>I noticed in <a href="http://www.koreaherald.co.kr/">The Korea Herald</a> which has a crap web page and seems to missing stories from the 0.70USD printed version, that <a href="http://www.lenovo.com">Lenovo</a> signed a 1.2billion <span class="caps">USD</span> deal to become the first Chinese hardware manufacturer to include genuine Windows operating software for all product lines!</p>

<p>Well done guys! You got screwed.</p>
