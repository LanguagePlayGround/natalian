<p>Shhheeessshhh! The geek crowd doesn&#8217;t get it? Ctrl-{x,c,v} is the <strong>standard</strong>. We are living with the Microsoft legacy. Bite it.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t use Gnome, but collegues use <span class="caps">KDE</span> and the <strong>klipboard</strong>-clipboard-daemon was one of the most annoying aspects I found with <span class="caps">KDE</span>. I&#8217;ll look again at it and probably weep.</p>
