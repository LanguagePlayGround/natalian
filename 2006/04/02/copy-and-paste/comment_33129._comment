<p>Hi dude,</p>

<p>Very valid points lol.<br />
I&#8217;m using X Window etc. at work everyday and I&#8217;m big Linux fan, but there is no point negating everything from other camp, especially if it is good. Ctrl+{c,v,x} is comfortable, everyone knows that and fact is it works much better in MS Windows then in X Window no matter what environment you will put on top of that.</p>
