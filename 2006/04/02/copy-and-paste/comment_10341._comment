<blockquote>God invented "focus to pointer" to solve this exact problem. Clicking to focus is such a pain.</blockquote>

<p>Neither Gnome or <span class="caps">KDE</span> does that by default.</p>

<p>Firefox is far ahead of any other browser you probably use. There is no avoiding it.</p>

<p>Clicking the middle mouse button aka &#8220;scroll wheel&#8221; does have problems. I&#8217;ve seen very odd things happen when pasting into Firefox and the pages flash back 2 pages.</p>
