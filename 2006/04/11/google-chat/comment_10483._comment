<p>The other way around, I suppose? English UK did not yet have the Google Talk implementation enabled when I last used it about a week ago.</p>

<p>Still, that is a temporary solution. You could try setting the number of contacts to &#8220;0&#8221; and &#8220;Only allow people that I&#8217;ve explicitly approved to chat with me and see when I&#8217;m online.&#8221; Gmail tweakability could be improved&#8212;of course you should be able to disable this function. As you should be able to set idle timeout and the like.</p>
