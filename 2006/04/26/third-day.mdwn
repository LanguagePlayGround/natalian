<p>Yesterday after a good lunch I attempted to exchange some Korean Won to Chinese Yuan. That turned out to be a four hour mission. There is only one place, &#8220;Bank of China&#8221; Beijing branch where you can do it. I somehow expected Korean currency to have some sort of significance here. Apparently not.</p>

<p>I had several annoying experiences with Taxi drivers who would just take me to any &#8220;Bank of China&#8221; branch and not the right one. The main branch is actually hidden away in a Russian area. It&#8217;s lucky I am a little familiar with Russians, otherwise I would have been quite nervous. Every Russian either looks like a porn star or a hardy pimp. There were many stores catering just for Russians. For example, stores selling fur for the ladies. Only Russians buy that stuff.</p>

<p>That evening I met a friend-of-a-friend and enjoyed Peking Duck in that famous restaurant out the Lonely Planet. Though I felt at times I was in a scripted tourist trap, the whole experience wasn&#8217;t too bad and it wasn&#8217;t too expensive either. The way you eat Peking duck is quite sophisticated. Several little ingredients go inside with the duck meat in a delicate pancake. With chopsticks, this was quite a feat.</p>

<p>So yesterday wasn&#8217;t such a bad day, especially after such a feast. My sleep was interrupted by a &#8220;sleep talker&#8221; on the next bunk in my dormitory. Yes, I&#8217;ve moved out the hotel to join my backpacker kindred. In the morning I talked to him and he turned out to be my backpacker nightmare character. An old fellow who has stayed in the hostel for months. Additionally a Christian. I dared to ask if he believed in Evolution. Oh damn, a rambling non-debate ensued. I don&#8217;t want to move hostels, so I&#8217;ll just have to cope with this guy.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s mission was to visit the &#8220;Forbidden city&#8221;. Christ almighty. That was certainly a mission. Once again I felt like a complete tourist walking a well trodden path. The trouble is the complex is stupidly large. I was soon exhausted and not really enjoying viewing throne after throne after &#8220;heavenly&#8221; courtyard. There are quite a few scams running, such as the &#8220;art students&#8221;, &#8220;rickshaws&#8221; and &#8220;tour guides&#8221; nagging you. Not nearly as bad as India, but really, when you are tired you really don&#8217;t want that.</p>

<p>The weather since the first day has got worse. A dusty fog permanently shrouds this city, giving everything quite a dull dark appearance. Since visiting the palaces and gardens, I&#8217;ve returned to the hostel and now I&#8217;m starting to enjoy the cheap beer (3 Juan!). I have not quite determined yet what spirit will really make this day special.</p>
