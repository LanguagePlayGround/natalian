<p>Just to scratch an itch, I tried migrating / side-grading to Ubuntu from Debian Etch. I still haven&#8217;t quite succeeded as I am still <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2006-April/017040.html">wrestling with aptitude,</a> but I did find something interesting from my <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2006-April/017029.html">Etch migration discussion on ubuntu-devel.</a></p>

<p>Marco Cabizza says that one of the reasons it is quite hard to migrate is due to the <a href="https://launchpad.net/faq">Launchpad</a> <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2006-April/017054.html">integration.</a></p>

<p>This sent alarm bells ringing as Launchpad is proprietary and since I might be developing an Ubuntu derivative, I didn&#8217;t want to be necessarily locked to the Launchpad suite. The <a href="http://static.natalian.org/2006-04-04/apt-cache-rdepends-liblaunchpad-integration0.dapper">packages with launchpad integration</a> seem to be a bunch of Gnome centric software which thankfully doesn&#8217;t worry me. But what if more and more packages are integrated?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think it will happen as it is too <strong>hard</strong> to easily manage many divergent patched packages. Ubuntu is probably sensibly catching crashes from the Gnome applications so they can make an even slicker desktop.</p>
