<p>A couple comments.<br />
1-Kissing was allowed on tv 10 years ago. It was more like 20 years ago that it was banned.<br />
2-I totally agree about the most Canadians outside of Canada statement.  It tells you a lot about what it must be like living in Canada if the youth are flocking out of the country so much!<br />
3-USA has some damn good cheese. I am from the dairy state and we are known for our great cheese, beer, sausages and Harley Davidson.  But, the cheese that has won international taste tests is a cheese from the state of Vermont. It has beaten French cheeses and all others! So there. Eat my cheese!</p>
