<p>I&#8217;ve loved ThinkPads for a while now&#8230; and just got an X41 tablet. I agree with the fact that they have no powerful models or any upgrade availability on the lenovo site&#8230; however .. calling Tablet PC&#8217;s bad just because of that crappy drawing you posted is false.<br />
I could make that same drawing on a regular PC using Photoshop and a Wacom tablet&#8230; what does that mean?<br />
Check below for better work using Tablet PCs (but not my own).</p>
