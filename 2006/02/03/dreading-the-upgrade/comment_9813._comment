<p>I used a livecd and the cat method. It took a few hours to copy the 30GB across. The parted resize only too 30 minutes, which was great. Except I&#8217;ve yet to grow the root system. Oh crap.</p>

<p>Getting the new 100GB Seagate momentus hard drive into my Thinkpad proved far more tricky. It actually was stuck inside the <span class="caps">USB</span> enclosure, so I had to like bang it out!!! I hope I have not damaged it. I wonder if the 5 year warranty covers shock&#8230;</p>

<p>Getting the old hard drive out it&#8217;s mount was also tricky as one the tiny screws had a bad thread. Eventually I got the Seagate in. Though I couldn&#8217;t get the black cover with the audio holes to click back in.</p>

<p>FS!</p>

<p>Anyway, I booted it up and the Momentus is <span class="caps">SERIOUSLY</span> <span class="caps">QUIET</span> compared to the Travelstar. I didn&#8217;t need to go into the <span class="caps">BIOS</span> to detect the new hard drive, it just worked. :)</p>
