<p>Well, do you have a desktop system handy with about 30 GB free space?</p>

<p>I have just resized the partitions on my laptop&#8217;s <span class="caps">HDD</span> two weeks ago and simply rsync&#8217;ed things over to the desktop, repartitioned the <span class="caps">HDD</span> and rsync&#8217;ed things back again. About 35 GBytes in every go took about 4 hours in total.</p>

<p>No reinstall necessary, thing is still stable!</p>

<p>If you need any advice hot to do it with rsync, please drop me an email.</p>
