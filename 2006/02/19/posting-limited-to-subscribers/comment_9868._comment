I have set envelope_from=yes in my .muttrc

Thanks. I think another problem is my FROM: is usually hendry@iki.fi and                                         
not hendry@dabase.com. You see hendry@iki.fi redirects mail through                                              
Gmail and then delivers to hendry@dabase.com. I find this step                                                   
unneccessary when I subscribe to mailing lists.                                                                  
                                                                                                                 
Sending up a hook to change to hendry@dabase.com for list traffic                                                
doesn't sound possible. Or is it?
