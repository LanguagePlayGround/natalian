<p>Why don&#8217;t you post via Gmane instead? I find that a lot easier for a number of lists I&#8217;m only tracking sporadically, but it might also help solve your problem (because then your Gmane identity will be used for the postings, not your regular email). <a href="http://gmane.org/">http://gmane.org/</a></p>

<p>Incidentally, I believe Iki policy prohibits routing mailing lists via your Iki account (but everyone does it anyway, because they want to use their Iki address as their personality on the lists, too&#8212;but again, Gmane would help here).</p>
