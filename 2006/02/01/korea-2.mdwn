<p>I&#8217;m in Korea. Lots to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Figure out how to get Korean &#8220;Hangul&#8221; characters to show up in X</li>
<li>Figure out how to change my date/time to Korean</li>
<li>Get my locale setup for Korea</li>
<li>Figure out how to input Hangul characters</li>
</ul>

<p>I have Internet at home at long last. (I couldn&#8217;t get Internet in Australia without signing up for an annual contract!)</p>

<p>200kb/sec to Dreamhost. I also seem to have my own exposed (dynamic! sigh) IP without a firewall. I&#8217;ll have to cook something up with iptables quickly.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to going to Seoul&#8217;s &#8220;Electronic Market&#8221; and getting some bits and pieces. One of those new Seagate hard drives for my laptop I&#8217;m hoping. Perhaps an MP3 player too.</p>

<p>Btw, upgraded to Wordpress 2.0. Notice any problems? Let me know&#8230;</p>
