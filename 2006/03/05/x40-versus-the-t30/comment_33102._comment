<p>I got an x40 back in 2005. <br />
It came with a 40gig drive and an extended battery.<br />
The extended battery used to last me about 7.5hours for text editing<br />
or about 2.5&#8211;3 hours of heavy stuff, like playing games, compileing, etc.<br />
Im very happy with it, althou sometimes not haveing a cd drive can be a pain.<br />
Im running gentoo on it and its great.<br />
Well now after so many years, the battery time is quiet a bit down. Time for a new battery soon.</p>
