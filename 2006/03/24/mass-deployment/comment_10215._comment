<p>We&#8217;re using a <span class="caps">LTSP</span>-like setup, and wer&#8217;re a <span class="caps">NGO</span> in Europe. Recycling old P2s with 64MB <span class="caps">RAM</span> as<br />
clients is <strong>only</strong> possible with a setup like this. And our server is not that large at <br />
all, in fact it has less horsepower than many &#8220;fat clients&#8221; today.</p>
