<p>I just come across this interesting resource: <a href="http://www.greenstar.org/butterflies/Hole-in-the-Wall.htm">http://www.greenstar.org/butterflies/Hole-in-the-Wall.htm</a></p>

<blockquote>
Q: Are you saying that if we put computers in all the slums, slum kids could become literate on their own?

<p>A: I&#8217;m saying that, in situations where we cannot intervene very frequently, you can multiply the effectiveness of 10 teachers by 100 &#8211; or 1,000 &#8211; fold if you give children access to the Internet.<br />
