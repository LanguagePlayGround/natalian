<p>I think I have a great answer to your question.  I remember very clearly how I got interested in programming.  Originally I was a game player, like every other kid.  Then I realized that I could change the rules of the game.  I&#8217;m not sure how I realize this.  I probably found an archive of game &#8220;cheats.&#8221;  So once I realized that <em>somebody</em> designed the rules of the game then I became a game designer.  I still played games but it didn&#8217;t hold my attention long. (E.g. I spent only 48 hours with Civilization and no longer with any other game.)  I was more interested in the game design.  Then I tried to write some games.  That&#8217;s how I got into programming.  The last real programming job I had, I was working on Wall Street in <span class="caps">NYC</span> and it <em>still</em> felt like I was programming games, just the money was real. That&#8217;s the only difference.  ;-)</p>

<p>But seriously, that&#8217;s why I believe it is extremely important for games to be free software.  Now I have a daughter and I&#8217;m only going to allow her to play <span class="caps">GPL</span>&#8216;d games in anticipation of changing the rules.</p>
