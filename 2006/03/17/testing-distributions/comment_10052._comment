<p>VMWare is still non-free, but (for some products that right now i don&#8217;t recall the name =) is gratis, so maybe it can be useful (IIRC it needs a ugly kernel module to works correctly).</p>

<p>For the screen-saver, i use xscreensaver, with blank only (with suspend and power off =) and the line &#8220;stop-xscreensaver = 1&#8221; to my ~/.mplayer/config works as expected. Don&#8217;t know about other player like Totem, Xine, <span class="caps">VLC</span>&#8230;</p>
