Since I work at <http://hackerspace.sg/>, occasionally the topic arises of
how to keep your embedded device connected to the Internet in Singapore.

Basically it's a huge <abbr title="Pain in the Ass">PITA</abbr>.

Wireless@SG doesn't work reliably. It's a long running joke. If you
miraculously authenticate and get online, you will probably be kicked off.

Getting connected on **4G LTE** is expensive and a HUGE PITA. The cheapest way
I've discovered so far is to get a "Long expiry plan". The longest being
30 days for 1GB for 20SGD,
<http://info.singtel.com/personal/singtel-prepaid-data-plans>. You have to
manually renew it every month from the device itself. Good luck scripting the
SMS to top up! No one I know has managed it.

Getting **wired** connected for a little thingie is generally impractical.
OpenNET aka [NetLinkTrust](http://www.netlinktrust.com/) can take MONTHS to get
their contractors hooking you up. ISPs contract is 1 year minimum. Next you
will have little headaches like VLAN tagging to worry about.

There was an initiative for an "alternative" low power connectivity with
[SIGFOX](https://github.com/hackerspacesg/SIGFOX/wiki) but that fizzled out and
besides... it's one way & non-IP so lacking in versatility.

## And no IPv6

Even if you somehow get inexpensively connected to the Internet in Singapore.
You won't have IPv6. You won't be addressable. No Internet service I've found
does IPv6 natively in Singapore, leading to horrible stop gaps like
<http://pi.dabase.com/> where I have to keep an expensive socket connection
open just to be able to get at my device.

IPv6 workarounds like [HENET](https://ipv6.he.net/) aren't great because they
are usually very slow, expensive and badly routed. IPv6 needs to be natively
supported by ISPs and routes need to be constantly tested and maintained.

## Conclusion

So the above connectivity challenges really need to be sorted out for Singapore to
have an "Internet of Things" revolution. Initiatives like "Next Generation
Nationwide Broadband Network (Next Gen NBN)" & "Wireless@SG" sound awesome. But
the **devil is in the details**. A lot more work & consideration must be made
to get the **Internet of Things** sanely online and addressable.
