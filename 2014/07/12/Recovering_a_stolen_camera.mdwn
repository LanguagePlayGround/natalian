Well strictly speaking I left the [450SGD Canon S120](http://natalian.org/archives/2014/04/30/Canon_warranty_for_second_hand_purchases/) on the Airport bus (I think). I was so tired
that day. I realised this and contacted the Palermo Airport bus company hours
later to no avail. Also contacted Palermo Airport itself. No dice.

So I was thinking how I could avoid this situation or better find it in future.
I did have my name and twitter id on a sticker on the camera. Obviously this
wasn't enough for it to me returned to me. :(

# Searching by serial number

First off, the [Canon's serial number of the camera](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/13885397858) is NOT embedded in the images it takes.

# Engraving it

Casey Neistat [engraves his camera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddL-ycOksHM#t=192) using a [Dremel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dremel). I wish I did this since the photos / videos I took are worth more to me than the resale value of the camera.

# Ibeacon whatever

I noticed <http://www.thetileapp.com/> but I don't see how that would work. The
tile itself could only be attached clumsily. And only people RUNNING THE TILE
APP ON AN IPHONE in very close vicinity (0% chance) could ever possibly report
this back to me.

# Invisible markers and stuff

I think this stuff rubs off and the fact that it's invisible is a bit dumb. UK
police say they use this to identify stolen goods, but I doubt its utility.

# Stolen database of stuff

AFAIK there is no place to say XYZ serial of equipment is stolen. Wish there was.
