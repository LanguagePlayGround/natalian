Judging by [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ps9dn/thinkpads_new_clickpad_whats_the_state_of_driver/cfhxu41), the pad has no middle mouse button, which _is_ a dealbreaker, but the author has been able to disable the trackpad for mouse motion and reconfigured it as three large buttons. It wouldn't _feel_ right, but it sounds like a workable solution.

Let us know what you end(ed) up buying.
