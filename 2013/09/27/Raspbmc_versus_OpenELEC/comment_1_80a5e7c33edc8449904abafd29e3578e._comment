>Plugging in a USB stick in the top port causes the PI to reboot, same as Raspbmc

the problem is not the OS, but the hardware. when you plug a device to RPI it reboots because of the voltage drop.

you'll need a powered usb hub to avoid such problems.

I stick to openelec, because it worked out of box.
