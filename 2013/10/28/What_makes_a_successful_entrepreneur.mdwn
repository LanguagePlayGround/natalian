I'm actually sick of the word "entrepreneur" and I prefer something like businessman.

The media's conconction of dotCom "entrepreneur" is basically someone founding
/ running an IT startup.

I guess raising money from investors is a legitamite revenue stream, though I
dislike it. Most entrepreneurs waste my time and everyone elses with their
bankrupt ideas and even worse IT skills.

A **real** entrepeneur in my opinion has worked out how to generate money from
the product or service. Almost from day 1. Earning money. With a long term
outlook.

Something that most startups utterly fail to do.

It's not sexy sending invoices. Checking your bank statement on [bank's shitty
timeout-ing Web
application](http://natalian.org/archives/2012/12/04/Singapore_banking_surprises/).
Manually marking off invoices as paid since there is no way of automating this.

But this is where you need to be in order to have a **real business** and real
credibility in my book.
