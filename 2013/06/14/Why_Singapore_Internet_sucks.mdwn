That Speedtest is only testing [OpenNET fibre connection](http://www.opennet.com.sg/) local to Singapore.

What about Malaysia?

These were taken on a Friday evening on the **best** M1 Fibre product you can

# European transits go across North America

Basically if you are dealing with Europe, you are at the end of the World.
There is no routing west of Singapore. Lines typically go upto Hong Kong, then
Tokyo, then across North America. If you get better than 5Mbps to London you
are doing **very well**.

# Contract lengths are usually 24 months

Want a fast connection for just 6 months? Sorry, you're screwed.

# All paths lead to OpenNET/Singtel

Even though there is a couple of ISPs in Singapore, they all end up on the same
OpenNET/[Singtel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SingTel) infrastructure I'm told. There is effectively no competition or
innovation.

# No customer service

Want to complain to your Singaporean ISP about Packet Loss on their end
discovered by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTR_(software)">My
Traceroute</a>? Fat chance. No status pages or issue trackers here! No sane
email responses.

# [Censorship in Singapore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_Singapore)

Porn and Gambling sites are filtered by the [Media Development Authority](http://www.mda.gov.sg).

Adding filtering from a purely technical standpoint makes the Internet slow.
