The Adobe Flash plugin for Linux 11.2.202.297 is completely unstable. :(

[Flash crashes in Chromium](http://s.natalian.org/2013-07-28/1374992068_1366x768.png)

The workaround I use is to use Google's "Pepper Flash":

	google-chrome-dev /opt/google/chrome/PepperFlash/libpepflashplayer.so

Which only works in the Google branded Chromium "google-chrome" product. It
isn't free software. This is a complete disaster, since Flash used to work fine
in Linux. Now Flash 11.2 series crashes without fail and has become unusable.
