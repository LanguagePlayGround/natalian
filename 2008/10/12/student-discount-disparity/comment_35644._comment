<p>Oh man! I had never thought of the discounts in terms of keeping pace with income, but that&#8217;s so sensible!</p>

<p>In the Netherlands, the 20% difference model is pretty ubiquitous, if there&#8217;s a student price at all. Free museums like in London are really unusual: I haven&#8217;t looked this up recently, but the Van Gogh and Rembrandt museums will typically set a student back €10. Attractions (zoos) are about €20 across the board iirc.</p>

<p>In Canada, the funny thing is that &#8220;student price&#8221; can mean &#8220;students of higher education&#8221; or &#8220;children under 15&#8221;. The Canadians seem to have a sixth sense for figuring out which is intended, but I always have to ask and look embarrassed if it turns out to be the children&#8217;s price. Some museums in Toronto have free evenings, like those in Helsinki.</p>
