<p>Well, in the United States, you&#8217;re lucky if a museum offers a student or a military discount lately. Museums in big cities, like Chicago, often offer a student discount of about 25 percent off a regular adult admission. Also most major cities have a day each week where the museums are free for all visitors or free for city residents. Basically, you pay a lot to go to museums in the United States.</p>
