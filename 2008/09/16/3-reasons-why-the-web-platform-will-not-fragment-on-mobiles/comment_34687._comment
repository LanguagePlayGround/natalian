<p>Basic <span class="caps">HTML</span> works on most phones with a browser Alex. Unless perhaps you unfairly include <span class="caps">WAP</span> phones.</p>

<p>You can use advanced features like Javascript in advanced phones. Then you must make sure your application is usable <strong>without Javascript</strong> enabled.</p>

<p>If you are determined to throw money and resources to eeek out small &amp; temporary amounts of &#8220;user experience&#8221; then use <span class="caps">WURFL</span>. Reason why I say &#8220;temporary&#8221; is that these approaches &amp; techniques quickly become out of date and fragmented themselves.</p>
