<p>I&#8217;ve considered dumpster diving actually. It&#8217;s supposed to be particularly good for cheese. But I don&#8217;t imagine I&#8217;ll take recourse to it at this point.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m actually hoping to move to the UK (Leeds) about one year from now and write my dissertation there, at which point I&#8217;ll be happy to visit you in London every now and then.</p>
