<p>The deal with mobile widgets using the webruntime environment is that they are still not readliy available on devices. However, it won&#8217;t be long before widget engines will appear on Nokia S60, Opera v 9 (Sony Ericsson, Windows Mobile, Samsung, <span class="caps">UIQ</span>&#8230;), Access Netfront v 3.5 (Sony Ericssson, Samsung, <span class="caps">ZTE</span>, Amoi&#8230;) and eventually even Micrsoft. Good thing is that they&#8217;re all pretty much standards compliant.</p>
