<p>When you hear of &#8220;Brute force attacks&#8221;, you can generally find flaws.</p>

First off a brute force attack can <strong><span class="caps">EASILY</span> be
avoided</strong> by a correctly configured server or firewall.

If the server can&#8217;t raise an alert or throttle a brute force attack
after say 5 wrong attempts it&#8217;s really <b>badly configured</b>.

<p>With that in mind:</p>

Companies who sell security products for example with:

* long password lengths
* choosing certain digits of a password (note they would have to store an unhashed password, which is dumb)

<p>To offer better security by mitigating brute force attacks on the client side, are <strong>wrong</strong>.</p>

<p>Conclusion: Brute force attacks in most cases should be handled by extra logic in the server, not the user.</p>
