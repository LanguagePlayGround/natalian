<p>They need to know the last four digits of your card number so that they know which card you are using, you might have several cards but only one. I&#8217;m warming to the pin sentry it&#8217;s not that much to carry around with you, I&#8217;m just lucky that I don&#8217;t need to use more than one, I received my second for my Nationwide account this weekend.</p>

<p>Your life sounds so tough! Sucks to be you!</p>
