<p>Totaly agree that 3 services are appalling <br />
I have spent hours trying to rectify problems with them.<br />
They coerced me into and 18month contract with a reduction in my price plan for more money (Â£1 a month!!!)<br />
I have cancelled this 5 days ointo the cooling off period when i realised and they are not accepting it. I have sent several letters. My problem is that I have 3 months on my original contract and am not sure how i can get my <span class="caps">PAC</span> number in this time. I am happy to pay for this contract and will then cancel my DD. does anyone know if i can request a new number from them and they will give me my <span class="caps">PAC</span>?</p>

<p>Sorry its a bit jumbled but hope it makes sense to someone&#8230;</p>

<p>cheers</p>
