<p>Watch out for a letter in the post from Three. I received one yesterday detailing changes to the way I&#8217;ll be billed. I just phoned up and cancelled my contract free of charge due to the change triggering a get-out clause in my contract. Check out this forum thread for more info <a href="http://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/showthread.html?t=1093359">http://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/showthread.html?t=1093359</a></p>

<p>My contract was due to expire in November, I had no idea that it would automatically renew. I just assumed it would expire and they&#8217;d call or <span class="caps">SMS</span> to let me know.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
