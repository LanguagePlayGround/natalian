<p>I have to agree and disagree on some fronts.</p>

<p>My personal banking has been with Cahoot and Barclays until recently. Cahoot takes 4 days and it&#8217;s a pain when I need to transfer money, I think this is because it&#8217;s one of their terms for online banking. Don&#8217;t even get me started on Barclays opening me new bank accounts left, right, and centre when I asked them specifically not to.</p>

<p>I voted with my feet and moved to <span class="caps">HSBC</span>.</p>

<p>We use them for the business banking and they are wonderful. I am now transferring to them for personal banking too.</p>

<p>I needed to make an international payment for a conference, dropped my manager an email, received a reply within the hour saying it would all be sorted that day and it was. I have to be honest I cannot praise <span class="caps">HSBC</span> enough, compared to Barclays they are a shining beacon of banking delight, always in touch and on top of things, and they even took me out for lunch recently, can&#8217;t say better than that!</p>
