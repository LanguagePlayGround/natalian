<p>Yep. I was on specific world-wide cover when my camera was stolen. Despite having to provide them with proof that I was in Peru they seemed incapable of communicating via email and so eventually I asked my mum to go through it with them. They initially claimed that I was under insured as their supplier would not supply a replacement at what I had insured it for. If they had just gone to another supplier they could have saved themselves Â£200 but eventually they said that my mum could buy equivalent replacements up to the value insured, which meant that I actually ended up with better stuff, which was good, but it was such a hassle getting there.</p>
