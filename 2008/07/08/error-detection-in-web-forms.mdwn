<p>Can you quickly spot the typo between a form field value &#8221;+2731284325&#8221; and &#8221;+2731294325&#8221;?</p>

<p>Now what if the form field had a <strong>cue</strong>? For example a colour cue on the border colour:</p>

Colours provide instant visual feedback that there is a difference between the two form fields.

When you enter the same data again and again in form fields like your:

* username
* email
* birth date
* credit card number

<p>Each one of these &#8220;datums&#8221; could be associated with a cue. So you would subconsciously over time recognise you entered your details correctly.</p>

<p>This cue idea is useful for accessibility. People who are prone to making typos could use a cue (an additional band/channel) to quickly find mistakes.</p>

<p>I initially thought of form error detection, checksums &amp; cues when I accidentally mistyped a number from a business card <strong>three times</strong> into my mobile. If that business card had a &#8220;checksum&#8221;, with the number (for e.g.) mapped to a colour **hash** <em>chances are</em> I would have entered that number in correctly first time into my addressbook. Saved the cost of the misdirected texts and saved an awful lot of time.</p>

<p>So a cue is especially applicable in mobile environs. Anywhere I imagine were copy&amp;paste is not easy to do.</p>

<p>Of course a cue does not have to be a <a href="http://q.dabase.com">colour cue checksum</a>. A &#8216;cue&#8217; could be some other <strong>easily recognisable symbol</strong> like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingdings">Wingdings</a>, different <span class="caps">CSS</span> styling like border styles, Unicode symbols, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_cards">playing card symbols</a> and so on.</p>

<p>So I encourage you to please try my initial implementation called <a href="http://q.dabase.com/">&#8220;Get a cue&#8221;</a> with Web form input elements. For the developers amongst you, please look at the <a href="http://git.webconverger.org/?p=cue.git"><span class="caps">BSD</span> licensed code</a>. <a href="http://hendry.iki.fi/">Feedback and patches are very welcome.</a></p>

<p>Hopefully a defacto &#8216;cue&#8217; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Error_detection_and_correction">error detection algorithm</a> rises to the top that will help everyone improve their input quality.</p>
