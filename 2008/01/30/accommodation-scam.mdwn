<p>I&#8217;m <a href="http://guildford.gumtree.com/cgi-bin/show_posting.pl?posting_id=18833174">advertising for a house mate on gumtree</a>. I&#8217;m getting a couple of emails that sent my spidey senses tingling:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://static.natalian.org/2008-01-30/accomodation_scam1.txt">Evidence 1 &#8211; a model from France</a></li>
<li><a href="http://static.natalian.org/2008-01-30/accomodation_scam2.txt">Evidence 2 &#8211; a model from West Africa</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Sure enough, after searching I found a <a href="http://www.orcadian.co.uk/archive/2005/index14.html">resource</a> explaining it like so:</p>

<blockquote>
The scheme sees an individual making a large booking by phone or email and asking for a quote. The individual then sends a **cheque** for a sum considerably higher than the quote.

<p>The fraudster then asks the business to refund the difference, paying the money directly into a bank account. The original cheque is then either cancelled, or turns out to be fake.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>Any genuine potential geeky flat mate applications are welcome. Though right now I must admit I like living alone. Having a spare &#8220;guest&#8221; room in the UK is a huge luxury mind.</p>
