Since getting my [Canon S100
repaired](http://natalian.org/archives/2012/01/01/Canon_can_not/) late in 2011
in Malaysia, it **failed again** on another holiday earlier in 2012.

The annoyance of this Canon digital camera purchase is beyond
words. The lens could not be retracted, so it could not fit in its nice case.
I travel a lot. I chose to try to forget that I had wasted almost 300GBP on it.

**7 months later**, Canon have acknowledged the endemic [Powershot S100 lens
error](http://www.canon-europe.com/Support/Consumer_Products/products/cameras/Digital_Compact/Powershot_S_series/PowerShot_S100.aspx?faqtcmuri=tcm:13-942824&page=1&type=important)
issue and have offered free repairs.

Yesterday I submitted the camera in for repair **again** in Singapore and they accepted it
under condition that the body was scratched. Which adds insult to injury, the camera
could not be put in it's case because the lens could not retract!

Once getting this back, I want to sell it immediately. What a disaster. I must
have taken 5 photos with it. I find the Iphone5 camera is fine for my
needs anyway.

Due to Canon's incredibly poor customer service, I urge you to never buy Canon
products.
