To improve surveillance I bought another [Y-cam Knight
S](http://www.y-cam.com/y-cam-knight-s/) as the [Bullet
HD](http://www.y-cam.com/y-cam-bullet-hd-1080/) was too rich for me at ~400GBP,
and I figured if my upload is only 0.3 Mb/s, was there any point since HD
images will probably be much bigger! I did look at other IP cameras, and since
the camera module for the [Raspberry PI](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) seemed
nowhere near ready and huge lead times, I opted for the devil I knew.

Since the Y-cam's Knights are unable to [sanely upload via
HTTP](https://github.com/kaihendry/FTP2.0) leaving me with FTP, I
"hacked" my OpenWRT 10.03.1 flashed TP-Link TL-WR1043ND to become an
intermediary upload hub. I added a USB key and a FTPd, rsync etc and this took
2 days of life for this.

First day went down to a botched upgrade. OpenWRT 10.03 to 10.03.1 did not go
well with LuCI going bust `/etc/config/luci seems to be corrupt`.  I 
got it going again by relying on the failsafe mode and reset button.

After re-installing 10.03.1, I wasted a lot of time on getting [the ext4
overlay working because I failed to specify
**ext4**](https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=38974).

Once the `/dev/sda1` USB stick overlay was on, I had 8G of breathing space! Wow.
I installed [syslog-ng3](http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/log.syslog-ng) to
get it logging nicely to [papertrail](https://papertrailapp.com/?thank=97e900).
The logs are helpful, but [not the same as
`logread`](https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=176277) annoyingly.

Installing pure-ftpd was a little bit of a pain because `/etc/config/pure-ftpd`
wasn't enabled and I almost went down a [out of date OpenWRT
docs](http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/pure-ftpd) rathole with
puredb:/etc/pureftpd.pdb. `option authentication   'unix'` is fine!

I bothered creating a ycam user in `/etc/passwd` but I could have easier
configured my Y-cams to simply upload as root.

Then I replaced dropbear with openssh and friends like `ssh-keygen`. I created a
key for a new ycam user on one of my servers. Now to configure rsync like so:

	if ! flock -n /var/lock/sync-cctv.lck -c "rsync -a --remove-source-files /home/ycam/ ycam@remote-server:"
	then
		logger already syncing
	fi

I'm a bit wary of using `--remove-source-files` since the files might be still
being written by pure-ftpd. I tried it a few times and it seems to work.

I also don't quite understand `flock`. It works, but why leave the lock file
around once finished? I don't quite understand how flock takes a lock and I
should have fleshed this [lock out in
bash](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/045).

Getting the cron in openwrt 10.03.1 working was a bit of PITA since `logread`
is the only way to see output and it always gives it under a misleading
`cron.err` title. I found `*/5 * * * * sh /root/sync-cctv.sh` works
for me.

On the server where the motion detected images are uploaded, I deployed
software I call [Praze](https://github.com/kaihendry/Praze) with a slightly
different way to sort the images and of course a user/pass. [See the demo](http://cam.dabase.com).

Issues left:

* [Y-cam Knight cannot look out from an indoor window at night](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/7882864314)
* Need to play around with trigger times and determine if my upload channel is getting saturated
