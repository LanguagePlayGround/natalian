You need a <abbr title="Certificate of No Impediment">CNI</abbr> from the
British High commission, to prove you are unmarried.

First find a local notary for a **statutory declaration**, making a claim that
you are single (unmarried) - 2 copies - 200MYR. Check with your local consular,
because certain foreign citizens I'm told can obtain the <abbr
title="Certificate of No Impediment">CNI</abbr> without the statutory
declaration.

British High commission [fees
are](http://ukinmalaysia.fco.gov.uk/en/help-for-british-nationals/living-in-malaysia/our-service-fees)
332 + 10 (for postage) MYR including courier. It's an awful place to visit
regardless. You get stripped of your mobile phone going through security then
you get to speak to local non-British staff through inches of bullet proof
glass in a dire little waiting room.

Wait ~two working days for letter to be couriered. It's a shame the FCO can't do
it then and there. If you miss the courier, you need to wait and collect from
courier office the next day.

With the <abbr title="Certificate of No Impediment">CNI</abbr> letter in hand,
you need to head to the Malaysian Foreign Affairs office (MFA) in Putrajaya to
get it endorsed for 20MYR.

**Warning**: Strict dress code applies, no sleeveless tops. Putrajaya is about
45minutes out of Kuala Lumpur and you need to earmark an entire day to get
stuff done here. This pathetic bureaucratic town which reminds me of
Astana/Canberra has a massive roundabout with very poor signing.

The bureaucrat buildings themselves are large, however their waiting rooms are
small and they seem to treat the public with contempt, so be warned and stay
cool. Keep very low expectations.

After getting the letter endorsed, head to the National Registrar's Department
(JPN) in Putrajaya. There are two KDN buildings and JPN is in one of them in
Precinct 2.  Since we are intending to get registered in a different local (in
Kuala Lumpur) registrar's office, we had to get a permission letter to get
married from JPN headquarters in Putrajaya, addressed to the local intended
registrar's office. You can get registered in Putrajaya itself, so you can skip
this step. However this means you have to return to Putrajaya to get married ... shudder.

With all these documents in hand:

* statutory declaration
* letter from British High Commission
* Endorsement from <abbr title="Malaysian Foreign Affairs">MFA</abbr>
* Letter from JPN HQ Putrajaya
* Passport sized photograph of each person (blue background, Malaysian style)
* Photocopy of foreigner's passport bio-data page
* Photocopy of foreigner's entry stamp into Malaysia in the Passport (foreigner has to be resident in Malaysia for 7 days prior to posting notification of getting married)
* Photocopy of local's identification card, front&back

Then we head to our local registrar's office in Sri Hartamas to put in notice
of marriage.  You can then set an appointment to register your marriage on
applicable days between 21 days and upto 6 months. There is a minimum wait of
21 days after giving notice. They put notice on a pinboard in their office in
the hope that members of the public will flag any impediment to your marriage.
Silly that it is not online! The pictures are quite enjoyable. :)

Appear at the appointment with two witnesses above the age of 21. Everyone
needs to bring identification. The fee is 30MYR. Enjoy the little signing <abbr
title="Registration of Marriage">ROM</abbr> ceremony in a private room.

Finally don't forget to request an English version of the marriage
certificate (10MYR) so that you can apply for EU visas and the such for your spouse.
