Word! 

I'd probably also add that getting paper notices whenever someone credits your account. That's something I've never seen done so extensively and I can't even imagine what a waste of paper that is. At best, it provides value for 1 second. But more realistically speaking, most folks, if use banking for personal purposes, know quite exactly when money is coming and how much. It looks like a rudiment from the past century.

Also, the long queues. If you ever hear from the service person that you need to go down to the bank branch, take a long breath and plan your time accordingly (with a buffer). Even better, try to convince the service folks that you're disabled, because every time it seems to take minimally 1h to 2h time to get something done. In a developed country with litte resource and busy people, this sort of inefficiency classifies as criminal activity. 

On the good side of things... I do like that there seems to be good momentum in digitalizing services, convenience and probably we will see less of these problems in the coming years.
