Aliens almost certainly won't detected terrestrial TV broadcast, at least not at a distant star, it simply doesn't have the power and is broadcast near the sun, and isn't directional enough in nature.

Whilst I'm skeptical of alien life close by for various reasons even close by they are likely to detected us via other attributes, like Oxygen in the earth's atmosphere, a long time before they can pick up radio.

This is good news if you want to make contact, as the Oxygen has been there for nearly 3 billion years, and is a big hint that we have interesting chemistry. Thus any technologically advanced aliens within the range at which exo-planet atmospheres can be detected already know life is here and that we have attained efficient photosynthesis (which may be a non-trivial evolutionary step) or something similar.
