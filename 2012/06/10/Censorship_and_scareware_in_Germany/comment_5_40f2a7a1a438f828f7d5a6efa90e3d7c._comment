Well \"sharing copyrighted material is illegal\" isn't that clear cut, for e.g. [Fair use](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use). Ultimately I don't think a private person should be treated like a criminal for sharing. Prosecuting a 15 year old for sharing a Lady Gaga song... Is that the world you want to live in??

The problem IIUC after talking to a couple of Germans about it today is that lawyers are using a criminal loop hole to get the identity of an IP, even though copyright infringement is treated as a civil case. Folks share my view that this loop hole should be closed!

For example, say your IP is detected accessing material politically sensitive. What stops a sinister organisation looking your address from your IP, claiming simply you were sharing copyrighted data, then goes to your house and kidnaps a family member?

There should be more checks and balances here.

I don't think you can equate \"hate speech\" or cyberbullying or child abuse or whatever example you want to come up with, to basic file sharing.
