I found [Terence's HTTP code for
censorship](http://shkspr.mobi/blog/index.php/2012/06/there-is-no-http-code-for-censorship-but-perhaps-there-should-be/#comments)
post and especially the comments interesting.

Without entering the debate, I'm against censorship since I think it's a
slippery slope, though I find recently observed [German way of doing
things](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_germany) most disturbing.
i.e. the subversive way "media control" is conducted Germany.

For example you are free to use site like
[TPB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_pirate_bay), however your ISP is liable
to identify you IIUC. I'm not sure how they do this, I guess there are "honey
traps" commissioned by lawyers in Germany and then once they know your (German)
IP, the lawyers then contact you with
[scareware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scareware). The scareware is a letter
basically claiming you were using illegally file sharing and tells you to pay
~1000EUR. An admission of guilt, gets the charge dropped to ~300EUR.

The consequences if you do not pay, is that you will be sued. Many Germans have
been subjected to this "scam" (empty threat) and find it difficult to talk
about. Perhaps I'm too biased using the word "scam", since I really don't see
how you can realistically prove this in a court of law. Of course, their letter
is carefully crafted to make you confess.

I'm starting to think <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanfeed_(content_blocking_system)">Cleanfeed</a>'s
[blocking TPB in
England](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_pirate_bay#United_Kingdom) is a much
more "transparent" (ironically) way of blocking access. I prefer this simple
block this over being later threatened, which is far more **scary**. Worse is
when you are not aware you are being censored. UK's Cleanfeed IMO should
disclose their blacklist, so society can scrutinise it, like [Google does in
their transparency
report](http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/copyright/domains/?r=last-month).

The workaround Germans are using is surprisingly reminiscent of the way
Iranians I found were circumventing censorship. Iranians IIRC use Canadian VPN
providers and I've heard of Germans using Slovakian ones. Worryingly
inefficient use of bandwidth!

Another interesting aspect to politics is how surprisingly well the [Pirate
party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Party_Germany) fare in Germany.

There is definitely an issue worthy of discussion here.
