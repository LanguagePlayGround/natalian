When I moved I checked USwitch for the best looking deal and signed up with Npower's \"Sign Online 20\" tariff. When that tariff was due to expire at the end of last year I assumed that we would automatically be transferred to the new equivalent tariff, say, \"Sign Online 21\", but no. We were informed we would be put on their \"Standard\" tariff, ie, the most expensive one. When I called up I was told that I would have to call back on 31st Dec. If I cancelled our current tariff a day earlier we would be charged for leaving early, if I called a day later the cheapest tariff would be unavailable. When I duly called on 31st Dec I was told that actually that tariff had already expired, but since they'd quoted it to me when I had called previously they'd have to give it to me(!)

I think you are mistaken about the new law, as far as I understand it forces companies to offer you their cheapest tariff for you, not a competitor's cheaper tariff.

I don't know anyone who goes \"nuts\" when someone leaves a light on, but their point might not be about one light but the cumulative effect of everyone leaving light bulbs on.
