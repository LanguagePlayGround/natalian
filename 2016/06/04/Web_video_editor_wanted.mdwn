I hate editing [Adobe Premiere Pro
CC (2015)](http://www.adobe.com/sea/products/premiere.html) on Windows 10!

* Export locks up Premiere Pro
* Slow on my T460s with nvidia
* Loses my edits if I don't save carefully
* Youtube upload fails me from Premiere Pro

# An opensource Web video editor

1. No Android or iPhone app
2. Completely opensource
3. [Upload footage to S3](https://s3up.dabase.com/)
4. Mark in and out points from a [HTML video element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#the-video-element)
5. Creates a JSON file of all your edits... your in and out points
6. Your footage & JSON file are then submitted to my opensource video compiler based on [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/) and a fast H264 accelerated machine
7. Out comes your final cut which your view again from your browser
8. If you like, one click to upload to Youtube!
