My family & I have been grieving for the loss of Morley Allen of Fore Downs,
Cardinham who died on Sunday evening 10th of April 2016.

A Cornish man, a bee keeper, a good shot, amateur mining historian, a gentle
soul and a very dear friend of the Hendry family of [Praze
Farm](//prazefarm.co.uk/).

He came around for tea & a natter almost every day for more than ten years. He
was good company & we enjoyed his humour and wit. He was physically very
capable and strong for his age right until he was diagnosed with cancer.

I am writing this from Singapore where I've heard of this tragedy unfold in a
couple of short weeks after Morley complained of stomach issues. Initially
diagnosed as a non-cancerous stomach polyp, I assumed that they could feed him
[intravenously](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenteral_nutrition) but his
body wouldn't take the nutrients and his legs swelled. He deteriorated
shockingly quickly according to my family. He was effectively starving to
death.

My wife lost her father to cancer. I feel like I've lost a member of my family
to cancer. I'm angry, I'm shocked. I don't think I can come to terms with this loss
until I'm back in Cornwall in the summer.
