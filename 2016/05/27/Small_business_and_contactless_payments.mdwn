[[!meta description="Payment terminals for small business are too expensive and not transparently priced. I don't want to spend my money with big business for the sake of convenience."]]

{Android, Apple, Samsung} Pay <abbr title="As Far As I Can Tell">AFAICT</abbr>
all implement NFC contactless payments (aka **Paywave**) in a similar way, so
that people can pay from their mobile device, instead of their plastic card.

For the public and well myself, this offers me convenience as I don't need to
physically carry my brittle plastic Visa card around with me. One less thing to
worry about.  Furthermore, I'm going to assume that since it's paying through
my mobile, the mobile can keep records of purchases, which is really difficult
to do with my bank's online banking application.

For {Google, Apple, Samsung} this is awesome since they inject themselves in
this lucrative payment process. The reason AFAIK why they have taken so long to
launch is that they have been busy negotiating with banks on their fees for the
convenient value their mobile platforms provide. It's a fantastic money spinner
for the platform owners, and all they have to do is collect the customers
credit card information and relay it via NFC come payment! I'm willing to bet
they won't let any App developer get a piece of this pie by blocking access to
the NFC.

# Concerns

## Is it any more secure?

Tbh, I thought contactless payments were based on _something you have_ and it
would appear that this is not the case. {Android, Apple, Samsung} Pay just need
to **know** your credit card details and away they go.

UPDATE: I'm told there is some token exchange with Visa or the bank but I can't
find clear description of this. The token itself is stored on the "secure
keychain" (aka "trusted store") of the mobile device, and can only be unlocked
with your fingerprint.

## What about merchants themselves?

I feel **small business** are the ones that really suffer here. Even for those
who rent an [expensive compliant
terminal](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT205747), they often do not accept
small ticket items under 20SGD (which btw violates their agreement with Visa).
Why? Because the bank fees are just too high.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/kaihendry">@kaihendry</a> for large merchant debit is about 8p I think, for small merchants could be as much as 25p or so?</p>&mdash; Dave Birch ï¸Ž (@dgwbirch) <a href="https://twitter.com/dgwbirch/status/735650783090249728">May 26, 2016</a></blockquote>

For big merchants like Starbucks, this is not an issue, but for small merchants
who are selling an item for 5SGD... about 50c, i.e. their profit can be
swallowed up by a contactless payment fee!!

# What I'd like to see

## Clearer competition

It doesn't help that no bank has clear pricing on their payment terminals and
it's usually up for negotiation. But since the whole B2B sales process of
onboarding can take weeks and is incredibly painful, by then as a small
business you might be too exhausted to negotiate.

It also doesn't help that the [way terminals are
sold](http://bigspoon.sg/blog/choosing-card-payment-terminal-fb-outlet-singapore/)
is extremely complex. There are setup fees, rental fees, minimum fees,
percentage fees. It can be incredibly difficult to work out and it desperately
needs simplifying.

## Better security

Maybe there is security I'm unaware of in the {Android, Apple, Samsung} Wallet.
My concern is that anyone can copy my card and start using it in their Wallet
app. Please tell me it's not that easy!!

UPDATE: I'm told there is **one card for one wallet**, though I can't find
clear description of the security of this.

## Terminals that are mobile phones

A lot of terminals still do dial up verification which takes too long. I don't
see why a 4G enabled iPhone or Android phone can't be used instead of a
terminal to help the small business to take payment!

Help small businesses !

## No Visa / Mastercard

AFAICT {Google, Apple, Samsung} ride ontop of Visa/Mastercard's network for
integration. Why can't they skip them all together?

Costs ultimately for small businesses to take convenient payment are not
decreasing AFAICT.
