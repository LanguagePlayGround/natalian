I noticed a trend in Singapore and Malaysia, where mobile operators make it
incredibly complex to maintain connectivity without a contract.

Why? For a higher <a

Consider a typical 2GB prepaid offer that Hotlink (Maxis) sell in Malaysia:
* Only valid for 2 weeks
* You have to maintain call credit
* You get 1GB of 4G "FAST" Internet
* You get 1GB of 3G "slow" Internet

Then there are other factors. Some like Hotlink give you better deals if you
have their adware App installed. Or if you collect loyalty points.

Of course operators have different levels of coverage which are very difficult
to gauge. In Singapore, you can pretty much expect blanket coverage from the
major players but in Malaysia Celcom has good "country" coverage so the rumour
goes, whilst Maxis is better in the city.

Then you have to consider their network and bandwidth they are providing from
particular locations. [I measured it and I was
surprised](https://twitter.com/kaihendry/status/677323663188750336). But Celcom
I've found sometimes gives me "No service" in PJ, so WTF?! **Reliability** is
another factor.

Also speculated that [what happens when you run out of 3G bandwidth in a 3G
zone?](https://twitter.com/kaihendry/status/703505303581519876)
