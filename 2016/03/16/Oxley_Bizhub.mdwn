Oxley Bizhub is a new business development just north of Paya Lebar. Somewhat
in between the "heart lands" of the North & East, and the city of Singapore.

The development has an astonishing amount of terrible design & implementation:

* No clear pick up or drop off point for taxis
* Signage misplaced or just no signs
* [Blocks change numbers dependent on which floor](http://s.natalian.org/2016-03-19/block-numbering.jpg) you're on aka Block numbering doesn't make sense
* Unit numbering is not any easier
* Confusion over Oxley Bizhub 1 & 2. No one is sure which building is which.
* Terrible logo =)
* No shelter from the rain
* Walking paths that seem to double as roads on the lower floors, so watch out for cars!
* Entrance bizarrely in middle of estate, meaning there are [cow paths on the corners](http://s.natalian.org/2016-03-19/cow-path.jpg)
* A pool that no one uses since it's a bit exposed
* Lifts have no air conditioning, are slow and designed for loading. If your office is on the 10th floor... good luck
* Lifts malfunction frequently and maintenance don't bother to put in buttons correctly
* [Disabled toilet on each floor is often in a poor state; e.g. broken handles](http://s.natalian.org/2016-03-19/disabled-toilet.jpg)
* Moveable cones and sticks act as some sort of road partition. Frequently blown over.

Expect guests to be be 15mins late since navigating is painful.
