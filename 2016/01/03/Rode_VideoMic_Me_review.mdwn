I excitedly bought the [Rode VideoMic Me Directional Microphone for iPhone and
iPad](http://www.rode.com/microphones/videomicme) from Amazon UK for £48.91, hoping that it would solve the issue of
recording clean audio from >1 person facing the camera.

After using it for a week, I have discovered a couple of issues:

1. static/crackles in non-windy environments (I guess just by moving it about)
2. the dead cat seems to be needed almost all the time (bit ridiculous)
3. captures electrical noise whilst being charged by lightning cable
4. was hoping I could monitor sound whilst recording but you can't from the rear headphone jack
5. if you click/plug it in whilst recording, I found you can get crazy mis-aligned audio!

* More about the [Magewell USB3 capture](/2015/03/13/HDMI_in/)
* More about my [Archlinux recording setup](http://dabase.com/blog/Screencasting_from_Archlinux_gotchas/)

So my rating is 2/5 atm. Disappointed.

UPDATE: I should have read [B&H reviews before ordering from Amazon
UK](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1186598-REG/rode_videomic_me_directional_mic.html).
