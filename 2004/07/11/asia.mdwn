<p>Instead of revising for a statistics examination I have been day dreaming about leaving Helsinki (and its piss poor weather) and embarking on a <a href="http://trip.natalian.org">trip to Asia.</a></p>

<p>I also updated my <a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/hendry/cv/">CV.</a> Any comments about this <a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/hendry/cv/x39.html">career goal?</a><br />
Does it make sense? :)</p>

<p>I am looking for a job in Asia.</p>
