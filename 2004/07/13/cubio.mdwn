<p>I received a couple messages of spam via my mobile from <a href="http://cubio.fi/">Cubio,</a> so I wrote to <a href="http://dnafinland.fi/"><span class="caps">DNA</span></a> my operator:</p>

<pre>
I have received two text messages from Cubio, one just now and one
yesterday. They seem to advertising how to change to their service.

<p>These messages were unprompted. I find them quite annoying. And they&#8217;re<br />
not good for your business either.<br />
</pre></p>

<p>And <span class="caps">DNA</span> replied:</p>

<pre>
Thank you for your message.

<p>I understand that it probably is annoying to receive advertisements<br />
from another operator and you are right, it&#8217;s not good business for<br />
<span class="caps">DNA</span>. Unfortunately <span class="caps">DNA</span> can&#8217;t do anything about this. Your number is<br />
unlisted and you have a restriction for post by E-mail.</p>

<p>This means that your number is not available in the number enquiries<br />
and that you won&#8217;t receive e-mail from <span class="caps">DNA</span>.</p>

<p>If Cubio has received your number, it must be from somewhere else.<br />
</pre></p>

<p>So, spamming is legal if you&#8217;re phone number is listed?</p>
