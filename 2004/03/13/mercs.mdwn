<p>I am updating this post to smother my sensitive premature post about mercenaries.</p>

<p>Lets take <a href="http://www.netcentral.co.uk/~cobus/32BAT.htm">32 Battalion</a> in this <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3504748.stm">recent story by the <span class="caps">BBC</span></a>.</p>

<p>The largely white South African Defence Force was backed by the Americans and British to fight a war in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Angola">Angola</a> against the (Cuban) communists, backed by the Soviets.</p>

<p>Many young South Africans were out there fighting in the bush, gaining years of experience.</p>

<p>The war sort of ended only in 1989. Just a couple of years later all these South African battalions were effectively disbanded.</p>

<acronym title="South African Defence Force">SADF</acronym> veterans are out of work. So some of them form a company supplying a demand to security services such as protecting oil fields for companies such as <acronym title="British Petroleum">BP</acronym>.

<p>So are there any surprises when several south africans get caught on a plane on another job in the interest of companies who want to exploit Africa&#8217;s natural resources?</p>
