<p>Seperate media into which device is was taken with:</p>

<p>/media/kodak<br />
/media/screenshot<br />
/media/olympus</p>

<p>This keeps filenames consistent. Filenames are extremely important to work out the date when <span class="caps">EXIF</span> fails.</p>

<p>File duplicates aren&#8217;t a problem.</p>

<p>So how them stored like that, and have a completely seperate viewer of the media. Viewer needs to cache/store thumbnails/previews, and keep /yyyy/mm/dd browsing structure.</p>

<p>Viewer should use link elements for site navigation.</p>

<p>A form should be presented with the picture to edit metadata and hide/show pictures with a password.</p>
