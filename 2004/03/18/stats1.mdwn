<p>Woo, I just contributed to the wonderful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> on the trivial issue of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tied_ranks">tied ranks</a>.</p>

<p>I am taking an Introduction to Statistics exam tomorrow. Five sweet Finnish credits which will be a third of what I need for a minor I sorely need in order to graduate.</p>

<p>I have also added a Section 11 about R in my <a href="http://dabase.com/tips/">tips and tricks page</a>, which is also called a <span class="caps">FAQ</span> confusingly. I need to migrate that over to a blog format or something as google does not index those beauties. Oh about R, it&#8217;s a great statistics language that produces <a href="http://www.r-project.org/screenshots/screenshots.html">excellent graphics</a>. I highly recommend the paperback book <a href="http://www.biostat.ku.dk/~pd/ISwR.html">Introductory Statistics with R</a>.</p>
