<a href="http://www.xiven.com/weblog/2004/02/09/MozillaFirefox08">Xiven</a> might be impressed, but since Firefox has come into unstable I wish you could hear my screams !

<p>Firstly my bookmarks, my settings&#8230; where are they? Why doesn&#8217;t firefox import them from Firebird, or if it&#8217;s really clever mozilla?</p>

<p>Why the <span class="caps">HELL</span> have they swapped around OK and <span class="caps">CANCEL</span> type dialogue buttons? Totally turning my world upside down! :/</p>

<p>And then the naming fiasco. Now <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-news/debian-news-2004/msg00010.html">there is a problem with calling firefox in Debian</a> as firefox is only for &#8220;official&#8221; builds. I mean, <span class="caps">WTF</span>!</p>
