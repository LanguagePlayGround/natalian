<p>After reading <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3935">Unlocking Your Nokia Phone</a>. I finally eventually AT <span class="caps">LAST</span> found <a href="http://www.uniquephones.com/unlock/dct4/dct4.php">phones unlocking code generator</a>. A web based tool for generating the code you need, as opposed to those <span class="caps">MORONWARE</span> Win32 applications.</p>

<p>Unfortunately they want to register. Assholes.</p>

<a href="http://bugmenot.com/view.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.uniquephones.com%2Funlock%2Fdct4%2Fdct4.php">Try bugmenot</a>, or user: bing pass: anonymous.

<p>Oh yeah, it work first time for me. I unlocked my sister&#8217;s Nokia 6100 which was locked to Orange UK.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s to the open market where consumers have choice.</p>
