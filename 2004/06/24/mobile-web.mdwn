<p>Actually, I have renamed my <a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/hendry/work/thesis/">thesis to &#8220;Web Engineering for  heterogeneous mobile devices&#8221;</a>. It&#8217;s a little more scientific sounding, although I have my fears about the word <strong>mobile</strong>. Perhaps it just be <em>wireless small computing devices</em>.</p>

<a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1007881.html">Variability of mobile phones</a> is an issue, but all the same I do believe mobile phones are consolidating PDAs, "smart phones", cameras and even the humble wristwatch. ;)

<p>Before I start enjoying my freezing Juhannus summer holiday I must throw in my 2 cents about the <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/archives/2004/06/23/web_apps_are/index.php">hubbub surrounding web applications and mobiles</a>. I would love to see it all work out but you have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using javascript hackery in IE6 to <strong>just about do</strong> web applications with <a href="http://www.mod-pubsub.org/kn_docs/faq.html">like so</a> and <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-forms/current-work/">so</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.openmobilealliance.org/"><span class="caps">OMA</span></a>&#8216;s <span class="caps">XHTML</span> MP for mobile phones and really <strong>really</strong> bad default Nokia user agents</li>
<li>Macromedia&#8217;s (amongst others) Flash/<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/flex/">Flex</a> doing real plugin representing</li>
<li>W3C in the background with flops like UA profiles&#8230;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html">Microsoft&#8217;s Avalon</a> grappling for market share</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway it&#8217;s a turbulent time and by no means a time of convergence. Another point I&#8217;ll attempt to make is that people are raving about the network as the computer, server is Ã¼ber lalala. If user agents continue to suck like they do and worse on mobiles, then we&#8217;re not going to move very fast. <span class="caps">OMG</span>, there are so many problems everywhere&#8230;. <span class="caps">ARGH</span>!! I need a holiday. ;)</p>
