<p>Interesting ! Thank you for insight.</p>

<p>I would prefer to see the user agent provide a generic useful 404 page instead of relying on website authors to do it.</p>

<p>As for Firefox. I don&#8217;t use it as it seems to be missing some features that Mozilla has. I can&#8217;t recall which ones right now. Ok, does Firefox have:<br />
View->Use Style ability? Do you can swap around style sheets? And does it have the site navigation bar?</p>
