<p>My Nokia 3100 seems to only have three sizes for normal text. For headers one through six, each one is distuingishable through bolding. E.g. h1 has large size and bolding. h2 just large size. h6 smallest size, no bolding.</p>

<p>I think the small size is quite readable and you can pack it quite a lot of text in there.</p>
