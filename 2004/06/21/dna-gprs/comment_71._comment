<p>I think <span class="caps">DNA</span> changed it service better by changing wap-service to full Internet access. Now I can read emails on the road and use <span class="caps">SSH</span> or even <span class="caps">IRC</span>. Although, there should be more options, but more options means normally more costs. <span class="caps">AFAIK</span>, <span class="caps">DNA</span> is still cheapest <span class="caps">GPRS</span> provider and <span class="caps">GPRS</span> is still way cheaper than any <span class="caps">GSM</span>-data.</p>

<p>And what comes to customer service and <span class="caps">DNA</span>.. they had problems when number portability came true, but since that, I&#8217;ve been waiting to get through about avg. 1&#8211;2mins.</p>

<p><span class="caps">BTW</span>, <span class="caps">MMS</span> is nice, you can send long messages cheaper with <span class="caps">MMS</span> than you can with <span class="caps">SMS</span>. Also including sounds and pictures are nice once you have used to it =)</p>
