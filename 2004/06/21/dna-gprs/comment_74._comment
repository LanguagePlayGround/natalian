<p>Thank you for your comments chaps.</p>

<p>This morning I visited a <span class="caps">DNA</span> shop and resolved the problem. He said I probably was accessing <span class="caps">GPRS</span> service through my <span class="caps">MMS</span> settings. I don&#8217;t remember how I managed this. Perhaps I correctly guessed the password. I can tell you the current username/password for <span class="caps">MMS</span> <span class="caps">DNA</span> server is dna/mms. :) <span class="caps">MMS</span> charges have not shown up on my bill all the same.</p>

<p>I was talking to the shop assistant and he said <span class="caps">GPRS</span> services are very popular. I am not sure if this is &#8220;Marketing speak&#8221; or the truth, but it was interesting to me at least. Another titbit, is that he and everyone else refer to this service as <span class="caps">WAP</span>. Hohoho, we all know <span class="caps">WAP</span> is dead, but the name lives on. Is this a good thing? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>

<p>People should know that they are using the <span class="caps">WEB</span> via <span class="caps">XHTML</span>. Ok, they don&#8217;t have to know they&#8217;re using <span class="caps">XHTML</span>, but they should know it&#8217;s just the web. Although since the Nokia user agent is so crap, it isn&#8217;t remotely the same experience as Internet Explorer.</p>

<p>Ok, last remark is that yes <span class="caps">GPRS</span> is expensive. I can understand why it is expensive after cooling down. However technology needs to make this affordable otherwise I don&#8217;t see the wireless web taking off.</p>

<p>Mobile operators must endeavour to switch an unified IP based system <span class="caps">IMO</span>.</p>
