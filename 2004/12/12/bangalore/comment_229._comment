<p>The government does not fund. It&#8217;s entirely private enterprise. However, the<br />
government helps the industry a lot. For example, a tax holiday for IT<br />
companies under the &#8220;Software Technology Park&#8221; programme. Companies also<br />
enjoy other concessions under this programme, for example customs exemptions<br />
to import required hardware from abroad.</p>

<p>As for Internet access, the only big carrier a few years back was a big<br />
government run company (VSNL). But <span class="caps">VSNL</span> was privatised, telecom was opened up<br />
for private participation and things are a lot better now. From a 64kbps<br />
leased line for the whole company about 10 years back to 45Mbps range now<br />
(that would be T3 in the US, I guess). Not heaven, but not hell either ;-).<br />
The main role the government played in that is to open up the sector and step<br />
aside. And that <span class="caps">IMO</span>, is a good thing :-).</p>
