<p>Several valid points, but:</p>

<p>> The console is a joke (no resize, autocompletion)<br />
It can be resized and you can enable autocompletion through TweakUI</p>

<p>> The pwd, <span class="caps">WHAT</span> <span class="caps">THS</span> <span class="caps">HELL</span>? C:Documents and SettingsMr Hendry.PRAZE-XE93FLBWBMy Documents<br />
Can happen if you reinstall over the top of an existing installation.  Normally profile paths are sensible.</p>

<p>> Start menu in XP. <span class="caps">WTF</span>?<br />
Right-click taskbar, properties.  Switch to classic start menu</p>

<p>> The search in XP with stupid dog that reads a book. <span class="caps">OMG</span> What a fuck up.<br />
Disablable in TweakUI</p>

<p>> Cluttered desktop with icons.<br />
Oh for pity&#8217;s sake, delete them&#8230; (ones that can&#8217;t be deleted eg. My Computer can be disabled in TweakUI, though probably not a good idea)</p>

<p>> Please reboot for these changes to take affect. Sigh<br />
At least it doesn&#8217;t happen every time you change your network settings :)  Ah, good old Win98</p>

<p>> I donâ€™t like the font as much as I imagined I would<br />
Then change it dear Hendry&#8230;</p>
