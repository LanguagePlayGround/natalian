<p>Thank you for the comments Henri.</p>

<p>I just sort of reposted this on the near dormant mailing list medium on <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-di/2004Sep/0001.html">www-di</a>.</p>

<p>I probably should be using another mailing list. :)</p>

<p>Anyway, an interesting link provided me a couple of interesting words to better describe that &#8220;scale&#8221; in scaling I had in mind. &#8220;Elastic&#8221; and &#8220;Liquid&#8221;.</p>
