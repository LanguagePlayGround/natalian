<p>Oh. C&#8217;mon. Just report them. I&#8217;m too lazy too.. :)</p>

<p><span class="caps">FYI</span>. I&#8217;ve heard the offline-feature is no good (vs. IE&#8217;s) and that the developers are taking it away for 1.0 as it&#8217;s not good enough. Does it work well in Mozilla then?!</p>

<p>Filing a bug would probably help for the Forms-issue on Speedferry.. well at least for mainly standard code.</p>

<p>And yes, funny how computer illiterates use computers&#8230;</p>
