0:03 <@Xiven> xiven.com gets redirected to www.xiven.com
20:20 <@draq> Xiven: explain yourself
20:20 <@Xiven> allowing both breaks history
20:21 <@Xiven> a page appears not visited when actually you have, just with a different url
20:21 <@Xiven> so i made a choice
20:21 <@Xiven> i chose to redirect xiven.com -> www.xiven.com
20:21 <@Xiven> i was leaning towards the other way
20:22 <@Xiven> but decided against it
20:22 <@draq> hmm
20:22 <@draq> Ok, I should have raised the history point
20:22 <@Xiven> also cookies
20:22 <@draq> but why not the other way? I.e. just xiven.com ?
20:22 <@draq> or blog.xiven.com
20:23 <@Xiven> i'm not using different subdomains for part of my site.  that's crazy (try getting digest auth to persist across subdomains)
20:24 <@draq> ok, I have to go. But I would like this discussion to continue. Esp. in light of Web apps

<p>The next day:</p>
<code>
21:59 <@Xiven> option 1 is fine
21:59 <@Xiven> cookies can be specified as .yourdomain.org to cover the entire domain
21:59 <@draq> ok
22:01 <@Xiven> like i said before, http auth would be a problem if you wanted it to cover the entire domain
22:01 <@Xiven> but if you aren't planning to do that, there is no problem
22:01 <@draq> why doesn't it persist across sub domains?
22:01 <@draq> the spec? or the implementation?
22:10 <@Xiven> not sure
22:20 <@Xiven> yeah, spec
22:22 <@Xiven> though there appears to be a way to give a list of domains
22:26 <@Xiven> RFC 2617 3.2.1 "domain" paragraph
