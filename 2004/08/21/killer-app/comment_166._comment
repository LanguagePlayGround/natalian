<p>Try gpsdrive.  It doesn&#8217;t draw arrows, but you can put labels on points.<br />
And you don&#8217;t need a <span class="caps">GPS</span> receiver (I don&#8217;t have one, yet I&#8217;ve used gpsdrive happily for a few weeks).  Oh, and you can download maps on the fly, at mostly whatever scale you want.</p>
