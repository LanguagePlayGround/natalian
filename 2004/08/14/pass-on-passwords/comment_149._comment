<p>Use <span class="caps">SSH</span> with ssh-keys, agent forwarding and key-usage confirmation &#8211; not only secure, it also saves you from typing passwords again and again. Typing a passwords happens only once per X session: on your local machine, to load your private key with ssh-add.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.puddingonline.com/~dave/publications/SSH-with-Keys-HOWTO/document/html/SSH-with-Keys-HOWTO.html"><span class="caps">HOWTO</span></a> on <span class="caps">SSH</span> keys and agents.</p>

<p>Make sure a <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-agent">ssh-agent</a> gets started from your X session. This is the default for Debian. You can check if a ssh-agent is running by issuing <code>echo $SSH_AGENT</code> from a xterm.</p>

<p>To be able to use your locally loaded private key on remote machine, you&#8217;ll need to enable agent forwarding. Agent forwarding is enabled by adding the following to your .ssh/config:</p>

<code>
Host *
        AgentForwarding yes
</code>

<p>Key confirmation for keys in your agent is enabled by adding the &#8217;-c&#8217; option to ssh-add: <code>ssh-add -c < /dev/null</code>. (This will only work within X &#8211; make sure ssh-askpass-gnome, ssh-askpass or something similar is installed.) Key confirmation makes sure your key can&#8217;t be used without your authorization.</p>
