<p>yeah my parents just got fleeced from t-mobile trying to disconnect&#8230;Ofcom are really bad in that you have to tried for 3 months before you even go to them. What happens therefore is that the customer services at all the comms companies do brinksmanship for 3 months then cave in at last minute if you havent given up and are still trying to get your money back. It&#8217;s a total jungle now. Plus the only way to communicate even scarcely with these dudes is to use their usually pricey &#8216;help&#8217;lines.</p>
