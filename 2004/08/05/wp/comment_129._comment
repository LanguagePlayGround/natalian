<p>Pakage seems to require the MySQL version from unstable.</p>

<p>dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of wordpress:<br />
 wordpress depends on mysql-server (>= 4.0.20&#8211;8); however:<br />
  Version of mysql-server on system is 4.0.18&#8211;5.</p>

<p>But WP will work with version from testing (4.0.18&#8211;5), right?</p>
