Every morning on my ride into Guildford from Woking around 8:20, a female
cyclist coming the other direction offered a smile. This has been happening for
more than two years.

Today was my last ride into Guildford, since I'm switching jobs and moving to London.

Our last moment as it were happened too quickly and the road was too dangerous
to turn around.

Hence I really regret this missed connection. :/
