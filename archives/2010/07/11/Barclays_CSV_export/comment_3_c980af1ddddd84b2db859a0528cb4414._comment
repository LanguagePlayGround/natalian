You were wrong when you talked about Finacle. 
\"I heard the Co-Op bank is rolling out this new Finacle software. Again there is no way to demo the site and know if anything is better and talking to customer services doesn't help as no one seems to know. Since the software seems developed in India and in Java, I don't have high hopes with regards to its quality and performance.\"
I don't think much about their Treasury software but their core-banking platforms are pretty good.

The best online banking software I've used thus far is provided by ICICI Bank and they use Finacle for both their core banking application (back end) as well as online app.
Allows me to download data for my account from 2006 onwards (as long as you put in date ranges that return upto a max of 300 transactions). Also allows for various download formats including MS Excel.
I work with a Banking & Treasury software company based in the UK and even the Head of Banking here knows better than to go up against Finacle dominated markets.
