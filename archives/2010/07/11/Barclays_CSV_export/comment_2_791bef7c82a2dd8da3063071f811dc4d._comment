Never wanted to do this, but under my statement tab I pick \"Download transactions\", it asked if I want a standard date range, or to specify one. Limit per download is 1 year (12 months). There are tick boxes for which accounts I want, or I can click \"All\". Asks what format I want (CSV is there) along with some other proprietary formats.

Only missing bit is there is no transaction identifier, and no balance in credit card data.

I'm paying nothing for this service.
