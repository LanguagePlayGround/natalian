Online banking in the UK sucks and it's particularly dreadful with [Barclays
secure online banking](https://ibank.barclays.co.uk/).

Why? Because they only allow you to export approximately the **last 60
transactions or the last 6 weeks**.

I'm sorry, that's insane. Imagine you could only see your last 60 emails. Could
you honestly run a business like that?

I've complained to [Barclays](http://www.google.com/finance?q=LON:BARC) and they said I should log in and **Export data** more often. Wtf?

My business relationship manager in the Woking branch said no one has ever
complained about this before and cut me off as I was desperately trying to
explain the problem in layman's terms! Brilliant. :/

Next Barclays (telephone banking) offered to send me the paper hard copies of
archived transactions. Er, do I really want to kill trees and spend my Sunday
typing up transactions? Indeed [this](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/4783122957) is what happened today. :(

On another occasion a telephone customer service agent informed me that
Barclays are rolling out a new [E-statement
service](http://twitter.com/kaihendry/status/18032311657) and unfortunately,
it's delayed. And from what I've learned, it only allows the export of data to Adobe
PDF. Bonkers. PDF is absolutely useless for my needs, it's just as useless as
paper. I imagine next time I'll end up typing PDFs into my editor.  _sigh_ :(

Yes, this is 2010 and yes, UK's service industry is hopelessly uncompetitive
for Web services. I'll move my account if there is a better alternative.

So what does the exported information [CSV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) look like?

	Number,Date,Account,Amount,Subcategory,Memo
	,10/03/2010,20-97-58 9047XXXX,-6.77,OTH,DREAMHOST.COM         UNITED STATES
	,08/03/2010,20-97-58 9047XXXX,-38.31,OTH,WWW.HETZNER.DE        GERMANY

Notice the number field is missing. So there is no way to conveniently identify
each transaction. :/

I obfuscated the Account number. Tbh, I find this field useless since the awful
form interface for exporting allows you only to export one account at one time.
So you would never get a different account number for this field, unless you
merged CSVs from different accounts or something just as uncommon.

The amount, is thankfully useful, though it would be nice to see a running
total like the paper Business Current Account Statement shows.

The sub-category **OTH** means something, like overseas transaction I guess. I
do not know because there is no key and no documentation. Another common
subcategory is **DIRECTDEP**, which is more obvious [Direct
Debit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_debit#United_Kingdom). And
annoyingly the paper statement has more useful information which is not
included in the export. For example on the paper statement I can see the
exchange rate and the commission charge.

Things must improve with online banking. I pay 16.50GBP a month for this brain
dead service from Barclays. Tbh I am not quite sure how the other UK online
banking services do, because there is no way to demo them, without opening an
account. I heard the [Co-Op bank](http://www.co-operativebank.co.uk) is rolling
out this new [Finacle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finacle) software. Again
there is no way to demo the site and know if anything is better and talking to
customer services doesn't help as no one seems to know. Since the software
seems developed in India and in Java, I don't have high hopes with regards to
its quality and performance.

My prediction is that some heavyweight like Google will enter than banking
market and it will be like shooting fish in a barrel. The incumbent online
banking industry needs to seriously wake up. Their conservative attitude has
created a really crap online banking platform.
