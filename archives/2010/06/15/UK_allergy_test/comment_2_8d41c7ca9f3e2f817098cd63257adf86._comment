That's how private health insurances work, even abroad. You have to pay excess and claim back. The only annoying bit here in the UK is that you can't just go straight to Guildford Clinic and claim back, that's how it works in Germany. You go to the specialist doctor and claim back afterwards. It's less time consuming and only costs 10 EUR extra to avoid the GP.
