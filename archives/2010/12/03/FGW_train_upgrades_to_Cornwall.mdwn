Since I can work from home one day a week and my [family are based in
Cornwall](http://prazefarm.co.uk), I have the following cunning travel plan:

80.60GBP for a **super offpeak return** ticket for travelling Saturday morning
<http://traintimes.org.uk/pad/bod>

Saturday mornings, unlike Friday evenings should not suffer from over crowding.

Since it's a Saturday too and for that length of journey I'll upgrade to First
class for 20GBP with a [Weekend First
upgrade](http://www.firstgreatwestern.co.uk/Content.aspx?id=60). Depending on
train manager, that might include tea & coffee.

Incidentally Weekend First upgrades typically also apply to public holidays!

Then I plan to return on the last [London train from
Bodmin](http://traintimes.org.uk/bod/pad) on Monday evening (there is travel
restrictions typically in the morning).

I have other tips related to this fantastic 4hr FGW train journey home:
