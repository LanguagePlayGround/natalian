I bought a re-furb (alarm bells ringing) Time Capsule from the Apple store to
replace a WRT54G-L as a WDS node at Praze Farm.

At the same time I fitted the
[Buffalo](http://natalian.org/archives/2010/11/15/Buffalo_WZR-HP-G300NH_DD-WRT_disappointment)
as the master Wifi point. With these two new Wireless-N devices I was hoping to
see an upgrade in performance reliability. Unfortunately this is not the case.

Firstly this version 7.4.2 Airport is configured to Participate in a WDS network
and allow wireless clients.

	Description:	KodakESP7+0687
	Location:
	Driver:	KODAK ESP 7/9 All-in-One Printer (color, 2-sided printing)
	Connection:	dnssd://KodakESP7%2B0687._pdl-datastream._tcp.local./?bidi
	Defaults:	job-sheets=none, none media=na_letter_8.5x11in sides=one-sided

One thing is the Macbook doesn't seem to able to back up to the Time
capsule, unless directly associated with the Airport.

I seems like they are on different networks, but I am able to ping from the
Buffalo to Time Capsule connected devices and vice versa. What am I missing?

More annoyingly, is that the printer is associated to the Airport instead of
the Buffalo and I can't print unless I am again directly associated with the
Airport.

Can anyone help?
