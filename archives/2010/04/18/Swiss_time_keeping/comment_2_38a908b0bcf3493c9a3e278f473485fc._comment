See how the second hand sweeps? I believe this motion is the gold mark for Swiss or whoever luxury watch manufacters.

Tbh I am happy with my GW-M5600-1ER  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_clock> watch.


It's hard for me to monitor the time trains I supposed to arrive as they don't publicise this time very well. I must say in my relative experience, UK trains are more likely to be late than not. Then again I am not sure exactly what the definitions of late are anymore either.

I prefer if trains left on time. How can trains be expected to arrive on time, when trains on leaving on time?
