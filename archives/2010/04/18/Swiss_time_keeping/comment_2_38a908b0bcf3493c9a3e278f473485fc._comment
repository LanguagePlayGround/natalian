See how the second hand sweeps? I believe this motion is the gold mark for Swiss or whoever luxury watch manufacturers.

Tbh I am happy with my Casio GW-M5600-1ER <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_clock> watch from [[archives/2009/11/08/G-shock_510_replacement_strap_sought]].


It's hard for me to monitor the time trains I supposed to arrive as they don't publicise this time very well. I must say in my relative experience, UK trains are more likely to be late than not. Then again I am not sure exactly what the definitions of late are anymore either.

I prefer if trains left on time. How can trains be expected to arrive on time, when trains on leaving on time?
