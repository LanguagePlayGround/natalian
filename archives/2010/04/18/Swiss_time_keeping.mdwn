Swiss time keeping is a little disappointing. I have issues with their trains
and their luxury watch brands.

Firstly the Swiss train clock hand doesn't sweep (like a Rolex), how you would
expect them to function. When the round pointed red second hand passes the zero
mark, it sort of halts and then continues. It could be more accurate.

I also noticed a broken clock in Zurich HBF. As a nation I would be concerned.

Next the trains unlike the UK do not leave on time. In the UK train doors
typically lock 30 seconds before departure. This ensures the train departs on
time.

In Switzerland the trains observed from my radio synced watch depart typically
30 seconds late, however I have not checked trains arrive on time, which can be
argued as being more important.

Switzerland's famed luxury watches AFAIK pride themselves on traditional
workmanship. Workmanship that does not include any radio sync functionality, so
the watch has a small chance to be accurately set to the second.
