I've enjoyed a long email exchange with Anthony from [Consult Hyperion](http://www.chyp.com), the digital money experts. Here are some quotes:

	It has to do with the historical install base of PDQ machines being dial-up.
	The goal of CHIP (EMV) and PIN originally was to get more transactions offline.
	However, those peskie fraudsters managed to create fraudulent transactions on
	Mag stripe cards so when issuers came to issue CHIP and PIN cards some issuers
	set the cards to go online quite frequently.

	Therefore, the EMV objective to drive more transactions offline and the
	emergence of high risk card products 'Pre-Paid' mean that more cards will
	demand to go online all the time.

	However, the poor acquirers have not got the necessary business case (Money) to
	upgrade their CHIP and PIN terminals as they have only just upgraded them to
	CHIP and PIN.  An expensive process built on the assumption more transactions
	would now be offline, an assumption that proved false.
