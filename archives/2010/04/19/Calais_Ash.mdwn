## The currency of a disaster is information.

Once again, that [Eyjafjallajoekull](http://eyjafjallajoekull.com) volcanic ash
eruption marked a painful ordeal of little or no information.

Firstly if my 100EUR [Easyjet](http://www.easyjet.com) flight home from Geneva was cancelled earlier and
not 8hrs before the flight was about to take off, I could have travelled with
my sister to Holland.

Instead of trying to get to Paris from a crowded Geneva station in the
afternoon, I thought it was wiser to go to Zurich and stay with some [friends](http://www.chewhoward.com).

The train fare to Zurich was 50EUR, quite expensive, though I reasoned it would
be worth it for the good hospitality.

The next day Jamie my determined travelling partner thought it we should catch
the train to Calais. And that we did, via Basel, Strasbourg, Paris and Lille. We
heard there were **strikes** (no idea where) and we had no idea or not if the [train fare was a fair
one](http://static.natalian.org/2010-04-19/MVI_1553.ogg) at 200+EUR.

After arriving at the wrong Calais terminal 20 minutes before the last ferry
that night was leaving, I was pretty frustrated. By the time I arrived at the
terminal I was seriously depressed by the long queue.

There was no information when the next ferry was or how much it cost. By
midnight I was exhausted and thanks to [Wikitravel](http://wikitravel.org) we
found a 19EUR hostel to spend the night in. Unfortunately it's WIFI did not
work.

This was a wise decision considering if we caught the 3am ferry (that's
assuming that was the next one), arrived about 3:30 BST and then had to somehow
get to the Dover train station and wait for the first train to London.

Instead we caught the P&O ferry for 65EUR (expensive!) at 11am. That's after
queuing in the Sea France queue and missing their earlier departure.

In an ideal world busy transport hubs I needed to pass through would have free
Internet access. No login required. So I would have a chance to find the latest
information.

Next a hub could provide power sockets to charge various internet devices.

British consulate officials could help disseminate information and provide ways
of calling loved ones in Britain.

Co-ordination is the problem. The foot passenger queues were not processed fast
enough, so ferries left Calais with plenty of free room for passengers.

There are no organised buses from Calais Frethun to the [horrid passenger
entrance](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/4535304927). Once arriving in
Dover, there are too infrequent buses from terminal to London. Just one every
hour.

As [mentioned on twitter](http://twitter.com/kaihendry/status/12470666073), the
UK government sending Royal Navy boats to "unspecified Channel ports" is
absurd. **FERRIES ARE NOT FULL**.
