[Francois Freeing the
Cloud](http://penta.debconf.org/dc10_schedule/events/682.en.html) talk at
[Debconf10](http://debconf10.debconf.org), showed members of the Debian
community keen to help see opensource Web applications.

Francios's proposed free implementation of [Gravatar](http://en.gravatar.com/)
is a great example, whereby a user uploads an image of him/herself which
corresponds to a hash of their email address. In order to make this Web "cloud"
service rock, it needs to be quick to download that image.

The Debian community already knows about [mirroring
data](http://mirror.debian.org/status.html) in order to make downloads fast.
And we know about [CDN, aka content delivery
networks](http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/02/msg00700.html) and [GEO
DNS](http://serverfault.com/questions/30567/geo-dns-providers).

So lets pool our resources and offer
[CDN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) Web space (100MB?) to
free software Web applications. This will make the opensource Web services
competitive in all important page load times and perhaps make it easier for
user contributed data to be exported and "open".

I have [server space in Germany](http://webconverger.org/hetty) I'm happy to
contribute to Francios's project and other similar opensource Web projects. If
you think this is a good idea, please get in touch.
