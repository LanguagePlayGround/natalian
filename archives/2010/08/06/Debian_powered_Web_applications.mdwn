[Francois Freeing the
Cloud](http://penta.debconf.org/dc10_schedule/events/682.en.html) talk at
[Debconf10](http://debconf10.debconf.org), showed members of the Debian
community keen to help see opensource Web applications.

The proposed open&free implementation of
[Gravatar](http://en.gravatar.com/) is a great example, whereby a user uploads
an image of him/herself which corresponds to a hash of their email address. In
order to make this Web "cloud" service rock, super quick downloads of that image are needed.

Debian knows about [mirroring data](http://mirror.debian.org/status.html) to
distribute data amongst free software agents.  And we also now know about [CDN,
aka content delivery
networks](http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/02/msg00700.html) and [GEO
DNS](http://serverfault.com/questions/30567/geo-dns-providers), which point to
your local mirror.

So lets pool our resources and offer
[CDN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) Web space (100MB?)
to free software Web application projects. This will make the opensource Web
services competitive in all important page load times and perhaps make it
easier for user contributed data to be exported and "open".

I have [Debian server space in Germany](http://webconverger.org/hetty) I'm happy to
contribute to [Francois's avatar project](https://launchpad.net/libravatar) and other similar opensource Web apps. If you
think this is a good idea, please get in touch.
