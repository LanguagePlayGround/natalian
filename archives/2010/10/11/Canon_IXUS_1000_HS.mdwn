I've upgraded from the [Canon IXUS 980IS](http://www.flickr.com/cameras/canon/powershot_sd990_is/) to a [Canon IXUS 1000 HS](http://www.canon.co.uk/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/Digital_Camera/IXUS/IXUS_1000_HS/).

Since the "IXUS 1000" is a 10th anniversary device on the IXUS range, of which
I've been a fan, I was expecting this model to be particularly good.

Unfortunately my experience with the [Canon IXUS 1000
HS](http://www.flickr.com/cameras/canon/72157624832837217/) has
been flawed, which I hope <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(company)">Canon</a> will address in future.

Since it's longer than any other IXUS I've ever owned, there is no neat leather
case that fits this device. I've [asked
Canon](http://twitter.com/#!/kaihendry/status/26547523641) to no reply, about a
case that can fix this. The support channel on their Website failed. :( So
after-sales sucks. Update: I have found the model number
[DCC-1700](http://www.google.co.uk/products?q=DCC-1700) for the right fitting
case. Seems to retail at 20GBP :(

The "super slow motion" video quality is very poor. :( It's probably related to the Image Stabilisation (IS).

I don't like the top slider. It feels fragile. I'm amazed they couldn't do
without it, especially considering there is a dedicated video record button.
When you are in the "video mode" if you press the shutter, it takes a picture
which seems a little counter-intuitive to me.

The zoom is good, but since it's a compact, I really doubt I will use it as it's so hard to keep it steady in one's hand.

The videos it records are just gigantic. Can't I expect the camera to encode
the videos to a sane size? The camera can't take videos longer than 10 minutes
which is a little sucky.

I've yet to fully understand "FULL HD". So far the playback just seems big, yet
when I hit the **HD button** on Youtube/Vimeo/BBC Iplayer, it just seems sharper.
So there is some mis-match of expectations on my part.

Videos taken on my older IXUS 980IS had a helpful thumbnail. Unfortunately no
thumbnail is created by the IXUS 1000 HS. :/

HD movies on the menu hint claims it is recording at 1920x1080, in reality it
is recording at **1920x1088**, which results in a whole host of ugly scaling
problems when re-encoding from MOV. :(

I don't like having to press the power button to playback some pictures. On my
previous camera, all I needed to do is press the "play button", now it's a 2
step process with the camera lens protruding. :( UPDATE: If you **HOLD** the
play button, the camera does come online.

The battery life seems poorer than the previous model. The battery pack itself
is a incompatible size to the previous model(s). :(

The build chassis doesn't feel very solid. It feels plasticky. Perhaps there is
a better build version of this camera that has alluded me. I can't tell which
models will be made to a better specification.

Wish there was RAW mode so I could try [WebP](http://code.google.com/speed/webp/).

Sometimes [photos seem terribly unsharp](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/5071618462/) which I have not noticed on my previous camera

In other news I am [trying to work
out](https://groups.google.com/a/webmproject.org/group/webm-discuss/browse_thread/thread/e10a0e0155c24c54#)
what sort of post-processing I need to do in order to put the videos up on
<http://video.natalian.org/>. I've gone off **ffmpeg2theora** since it
segfaults on these large MOVs doing a `free()` at the very end of re-encoding.

The [IXUS 1000 HS
FAQ](http://www.canon.co.uk/Support/Consumer_Products/products/cameras/Digital_Compact/Digital_IXUS_series/IXUS_1000_HS.aspx)
is interesting if you managed to get there without the constant "Internal
server errors" of Canon's poor Website.
