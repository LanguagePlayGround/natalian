I've upgraded from the IXUS 950IS to a [Canon IXUS 1000 HS](http://www.canon.co.uk/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/Digital_Camera/IXUS/IXUS_1000_HS/)

Since it was a 10th anniversary device on the IXUS range, of which I've been a fan, I was expecting this model to be particularly good.

Unfortunately my experience with the Canon IXUS 1000 HS has some major
disappointments.

Since it's longer than any other IXUS I've ever owned, there is no neat leather
case that fits this device. I've [asked
Canon](http://twitter.com/#!/kaihendry/status/26547523641) to no reply, about a
case that can fix this. The support channel on their Website failed. :(

The "super slow motion" video quality is very poor. :(

I don't like the top slider. It feels fragile.

The zoom is good, but since it's a compact, I really doubt I will use it as it's so hard to keep it steady in one's hand.

The videos it records are just gigantic. Can't I expect the camera to properly
encode the videos to be sane.

I don't like having to press the power button to playback some pictures. On my
previous camera, all I needed to do is press the "play button", now it's a 2
step process with the camera lens protruding. :(

The battery life seems poorer than the previous model and it's also incompatible size to the previous model(s). :(

The build chassis doesn't feel very solid. It feels plastic-y.
