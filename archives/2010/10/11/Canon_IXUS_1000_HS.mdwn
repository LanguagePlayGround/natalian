I've upgraded from the [Canon IXUS 980IS](http://www.flickr.com/cameras/canon/powershot_sd990_is/) to a [Canon IXUS 1000 HS](http://www.canon.co.uk/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/Digital_Camera/IXUS/IXUS_1000_HS/)

Since it was a 10th anniversary device on the IXUS range, of which I've been a fan, I was expecting this model to be particularly good.

Unfortunately my experience with the [Canon IXUS 1000
HS](http://www.flickr.com/cameras/canon/72157624832837217/) has
disappointments, which I hope Canon will address in future.

Since it's longer than any other IXUS I've ever owned, there is no neat leather
case that fits this device. I've [asked
Canon](http://twitter.com/#!/kaihendry/status/26547523641) to no reply, about a
case that can fix this. The support channel on their Website failed. :(

The "super slow motion" video quality is very poor. :(

I don't like the top slider. It feels fragile. I'm amazed they couldn't do without it, especially considering there is a dedicated video record button.

The zoom is good, but since it's a compact, I really doubt I will use it as it's so hard to keep it steady in one's hand.

The videos it records are just gigantic. Can't I expect the camera to encode
the videos to a sane size? The camera can't take videos longer than 10 minutes
which is a little sucky.

I don't like having to press the power button to playback some pictures. On my
previous camera, all I needed to do is press the "play button", now it's a 2
step process with the camera lens protruding. :(

The battery life seems poorer than the previous model and it's also
incompatible size to the previous model(s). :(

The build chassis doesn't feel very solid. It feels plasticky. Perhaps there is
a better build version of this camera that has alluded me. I can't tell which
models will be made to a better specification.

Wish there was RAW mode so I could try [WebP](http://code.google.com/speed/webp/)

Sometimes [photos seem terribly unsharp](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/5071618462/) which I have not noticed on my previous camera
