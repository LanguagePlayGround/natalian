The [Soil
association](http://www.soilassociation.org/Whyorganic/tabid/86/Default.aspx)
would have us believe that Organic food is "planet-friendly" (whatever the hell
that means) and ensure the food you eat is nutrient rich.

Excuse me, how did you miss this [scientific report affirming that organic food
is no more
nutritious](http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/organicreviewappendices.pdf)
than any other food!?

Friends do not buy organic food. By buying organic food you are only supporting
poorly cultivated crops. Why support this inefficient unscientific dogma of
"organic food", forcing the price of food up when there are **millions starving**
in the world?

I'm all for better quality food, though do not sell it to me as organic.
