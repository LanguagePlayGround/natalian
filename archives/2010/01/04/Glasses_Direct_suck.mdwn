After [travelling around the world](http://maps.natalian.org/) I was relieved when
[Glasses Direct](http://www.glassesdirect.co.uk/) seemed to advertise
**reasonably priced** glasses in the UK in 2007.

Glasses in India and Japan are very inexpensive. Why should I pay more than
fifty pound for a piece of cheap plastic?

So I bought two frames from <http://www.glassesdirect.co.uk/> in the beginning:

* [Element](http://www.glassesdirect.co.uk/products/search/Element) for 15GBP
* [Mojito](http://www.glassesdirect.co.uk/products/search/Mojito/) for 20GBP

Both lenses matched my prescription with "Scratch-Resistant Coating" and I was happy.

After losing my favoured orange pair of Mojito whilst swimming in the sea, I thought I would gingerly order another pair late in 2009.

* Mojito 29GBP + 5GBP for "Scratch-Resistant Coating" + 15GBP for "Anti-Reflective Coating"

Urm, I'm paying 14GBP more for my Mojitos! That's an inflation busting 70% price increase!

Now with the January 2010 Glasses Direct catalogue in hand, the Mojito's now
cost 59GBP without the "Scratch-Resistant Coating". An **insane** 220% price
increase from the original 20GBP I paid.

Oh wait, but there is **FREE second pair** with frames at 59GBP or over. :(


Urgh, **fuck no please** Prescription Eyewear Limited. Do not treat me like an idiot.

I like many just want a pair of cheap prescription glasses. Why do you
**Glasses Direct** have to banally match your high street competitors like
<http://www.specsavers.co.uk/> and <http://www.danda.co.uk/> business models?

Isn't being online and direct supposed to make you different? Apparently not.
