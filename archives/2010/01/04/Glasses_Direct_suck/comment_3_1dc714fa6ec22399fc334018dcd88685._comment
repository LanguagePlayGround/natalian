Glasses can become a real hassle for people who suffer from severe short sightedness because then the glasses need to be way too thick and heavy. On the other hand, some contacts are actually designed to cure short sightedness without making the wearer's eyes look small. Also, if there is a huge gap between the visual capabilities of the two eyes then glasses cannot really provide much help and contacts are the only viable solution.
