I think I have been asked [how help should
work](http://twitter.com/mpt/status/7970457991) on a leading distribution like
Ubuntu.

Well, I'm glad you asked because I have a few opinions.

I have help family and friends onto Ubuntu. I have helped collegues at work who
don't know the first thing about Linux onto Ubuntu. I've also actively sought
help myself for many many years on a whole bunch of problems that I've
encountered whilst using Debian & Ubuntu.

Let me start with what I don't like about Ubuntu regarding finding help.

* <https://help.ubuntu.com/> -- different versions of help for different version of Ubuntu? Wrong.
* -docs packages. I hate that. It's a waste of space. Sorry, assume you have Internet.
* GNU info pages -- a lot of GNU stuff is stupid. Don't forget that.
* https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDownUnder/BOFs/CommandLineDisintegration
* Work closer with magazines and LUGs
* [Use cases](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HelpfulHelp) don't address step-by-step **user experience** for brain numbing regular tasks, like posting a picture online
* Gnome help -- ffs don't get me started
* Openoffice help -- ffs don't get me started
* Failure for Ubuntu to focus on the browser -- next they will be wondering why [Chromium OS](http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os) is far more popular "Linux Desktop"
* Launchpad. For every user, it should be painless to file a bug. A bug with a bounty. And if bugs don't get closed soon something is seriously wrong with the process.
* I think sharing desktop works, but I never had it working from my Debian or Arch machine on a friends machine. Why? You tell me.
* Having to type the users password every 10ms.
* The update process is a PITA.
* Bloat bloat bloat, cut it out.
* Wiki is too slow. Web applications by Canonical just suck imho. Use PHP and just make it FAST, ok?
* Spam and other idiocy

What I do like:

* the Web browser
* <http://manpages.debian.net> -- could be miles better. manpages need to come onto the Web in a better way
* IRC -- bit geeky
* an OS being slightly exclusive -- I'm sorry I do not want be in a community with complete morons who can't think or type
* stackoverflow & superuser -- excellent Web applications for learning
* LUGs and local mailing lists -- a bit geeky, but hellava important
* Searching with Google -- people must learn how to copy and paste in an error message
* chatting to friends -- people need to be introduced to Ubuntu, so it must painless to connect with them. I personally use Gmail.com's Gtalk to chat to my newbie friends.
* Getting a formal education in how to use a unix computer and how to ask questions or open bugs
* [Arch wiki](http://wiki.archlinux.org)
* Keeping things simple. Avoid buggy CRAPWARE like Gnome
* Having things work in the first place. I.e. doing a TON of testing
* Less is more -- don't support crap software
* The terminal -- do not be scared
* Use the power of the Web. I really like the rich useful comments on the [PHP](http://php.net/) site
