Despite the [DD-WRT](http://dd-wrt.com) [partnership with Buffalo hardware](http://www.buffalo-technology.com/technology/software/dd-wrt/) and the [stunning endorsements](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/09/because-everyone-needs-a-router.html), the router is really disappointing to my previous [Linksys WRT54G](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linksys_WRT54G_series).

If you bother to crawl the DD-WRT forums
[several](http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=82571)
[threads](http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=78294) talk about how
[unstable](http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=82316) and disspointing V24-SP2 build 14998 DD-WRT (Professional) firmware
is.

* For me the [WZR-HP-G300NH](http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Buffalo_WZR-HP-G300NH) is less powerful than the [WRT54G](http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Linksys_WRT54G/GL/GS/GX)
* It fluctuates in speed and power, and just has an unpredictable unstable feel to it (could this be a "feature" of [Wireless-N](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11#802.11n) ?? )


My [own post on the Buffalo
forum](http://forums.buffalotech.com/t5/Wireless/15dBm-signal-lock/td-p/44768)
goes un-answered, and contacting Buffalo directly is a sad redirect to (ref:
107218) <http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/> for support.

This sadly seems to be some poor execution and followup by Japanese
[Buffalo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melco). Firstly you need someone with a
clue answer people's questions on the DD-WRT forums if you won't support DD-WRT
on your [Buffalo forums](http://forums.buffalotech.com/).  The "professional"
DD-WRT is hardly niche, it's far easier to use than the default "stock" firmware.

Someone in Buffalo and DD-WRT obviously tried to make this work, but failed
somewhere. Still I really hope you address peoples' complaints and issue a fix
and try give your users support. Otherwise you are really going to screw your
brand over Buffalo. :(
