Despite the [DD-WRT](http://dd-wrt.com) [partnership with Buffalo hardware](http://www.buffalo-technology.com/technology/software/dd-wrt/) and the [stunning endorsements](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/09/because-everyone-needs-a-router.html), the router is really dissapointing to my previous [Linksys WRT54G](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linksys_WRT54G_series).

If you bother to crawl the DD-WRT forums
[several](http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=82571)
[threads](http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=78294) talk about how
unstable and disspointing V24-SP2 build 14998 DD-WRT (Professional) firmware
is.

* For me the [WZR-HP-G300NH](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/5129355769/) is less powerful than the [WRT54G](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/5176794484/)
* It fluctuates in speed and power, and just has an unpredictable unstable feel to it
