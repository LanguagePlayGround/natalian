* In this tutorial I use Ubuntu 10.10's vim 7.2 with <http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/IDE>
* <http://princexml.com> to generate the PDF
* Acroread and the CTRL+R shortcut as it unfortunately does not auto-reload a changed file
* A [Makefile](http://static.natalian.org/2010-11-10/Makefile) used with vim's `set makeprg=`
* A [letter template](http://static.natalian.org/2010-11-10/letter.html)
* [markdown](http://packages.qa.debian.org/m/markdown.html)
