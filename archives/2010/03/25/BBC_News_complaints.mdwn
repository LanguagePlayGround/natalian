Since [BBC News](http://news.bbc.co.uk/) doesn't have a mechanism to openly
[complain](http://news.bbc.co.uk/newswatch/ukfs/hi/newsid_4030000/newsid_4032600/4032695.stm)
about the crappy stories of late, I am going to rant here. Tbh I love BBC News,
that this week has been painful.

What a _non-story_. Honestly **wtf**. This really pissed my off as my father
called me, worried about security of the browser who uses. My German friends
didn't even hear about this. Why did the British media pick up on this ffs?

Gamed by an insurance company. Companies are desperate to get on the most
popular Website (BBC News!) in Europe. It's online advertising that money can't
buy. Every now and then BBC drop a company's name like this and I find it
appalling.

Blatant bias against the exploited victims involved!

Sam says it best ... the same thing happens in the US (they arrest the illegal
immigrant workers, instead of fining or suing the company who hires the
workers).  As I (Sam) see it, they arrest the workers because that makes the
bigots happy, and keeps other illegals in line (poor pay and working
conditions) without any rights.

Thankfully BBC News didn't pander too much about [Mephedrone](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/mar/22/charlie-brooker-newspapers-dangerous-drug).
