<p>Had a good experience w/ Savile Row. They made twice as many measurements as a cheaper tailor. Mr. Choe&#8217;s English is very functional. He himself is pleasant to deal with (the luxury of having an assistant probably doing all the work). He admits he&#8217;s more expensive than some tailors on the same street. A local friend said that you get what you pay for. I would say prices are what you expect to pay for good quality off-the-rack clothes (ie. my dress shirts were the same price as the Brooks Brothers shirts I get when they&#8217;re on sale). The material is not as good as a Brooks Brothers non-Iron shirt. So, why go to Savile Row? Because you&#8217;re in the area and you want a <strong>tailored</strong> shirt/suit which will fit you much better than anything off the rack. Conclusion: if you have an off-the-rack body, don&#8217;t bother with tailoring. I really like Brooks Brother&#8217;s non-Iron cotton, and if it fit me better, that&#8217;s all I&#8217;d wear. But when I want to look sharp, I&#8217;ll go with a tailored outfit every time. The nicer tailored suits were around $500&#8211;600, if my memory is correct. I got more summer-y suits for around $400. I wouldn&#8217;t wear it for a wedding, but for day-to-day business wear, it&#8217;s incredibly comfortable and fits really well.</p>
