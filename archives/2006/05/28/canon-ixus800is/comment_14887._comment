<p>Since this entry gets quite a bit of traffic. I should add that I get around the redeye problem with <a href=\"http://picasa.google.com/\" rel="nofollow">Picasa</a>. Post-production is quite easy with that tool.</p>

<p>I am managing videos now with Theora and <span class="caps">RSS</span>! See <a href="http://natalian.org/archives/2006/06/02/static/">http://natalian.org/archives/2006/06/02/static/</a></p>

<p>Still have not found a decent tool to edit Theora AVIs. I noticed that video blogging with 3 minute videos is popular. With a 1G card I can record 15 minutes of decent video. So this Canon IXUS800is makes an excellent \&#8220;video blogging device\&#8221;!</p>

<p>Earlier I had problems with video out of the device with a TV. In took me too long to realise the TV was <span class="caps">NTSC</span>, not <span class="caps">PAL</span>. :)</p>
