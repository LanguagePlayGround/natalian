<p>I don&#8217;t believe in IS for objectives under 150mm, let alone pocket cameras. You do pay extra for that. If it helps level out the shocks in video recordings, though, that might be helpful. This is a fine little camera to have at hand.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d probably use the 1600&#215;1200 setting. 2272&#215;1704 if I were filming manuscripts.</p>

<p>Looking forward to more of your video material 8)</p>
