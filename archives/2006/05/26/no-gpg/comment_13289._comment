<p>im not sure what you mean with &#8220;wiki like contributions&#8221;. Wiki like contributions the way<br />
i know them, do not ensure <strong>at all</strong> a certain person ist trustworthy. This is by far more<br />
worse than how the current system works.</p>

<p>Also, the web of trust does not mean to tell you which person you have to trust or not, its<br />
still <strong>your</strong> decision.</p>
