<p>Hmm. I have read this blog post as a satirical commet <span class="caps">WRT</span> the (maybe overrated) response to Martin&#8217;s blog post. But here seem to be people that take this serious, as <a href="http://blog.technologeek.org/2006/05/26/26">http://blog.technologeek.org/2006/05/26/26</a> seems to do&#8230;</p>
