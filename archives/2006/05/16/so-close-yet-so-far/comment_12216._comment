<p>Well, if you like LaTeX output I believe that reStructuredText is a good format, the rst2latex<br />
script + pdflatex has worked great for me for a long time.</p>

<p>In fact we are now using it in the office with a small sed script to change the latex document<br />
type and the pdf output looks great and has our own look&#8217;n&#8217;feel.</p>

<p>I suggested this format as an intermediate step before moving documents to other editors like<br />
OpenOffice.org writer (importing the html output), but it is quite probable that we adopt it as<br />
an alternate way of writting documents as all the people working with it is quite happy with<br />
the results.</p>

<p>The only remaining thing to do for us is remove the sed script (it was a quick hack to reuse a previously defined document type) and move our customizations to a stylesheet for the rst2newlatex output format, as it seems a better and safer way of customize the latex output format.</p>
