<p>Christmas has come early and vim7 has finally made its way on  my unstable machine thanks to the miracle of dist-upgrade.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve made some <a href="http://faq.dabase.com/faqw.py?req=show&amp;file=faq07.018.htp">notes on my faq.</a></p>

<p>So far the feature that might change my life forever, is omnicompletion.</p>

<p>Spelling is a little disappointing. In the help page it says hitting <span class="caps">CTRL</span>-X after a misspelled word will present some alternatives. Doesn&#8217;t work for me. Starting spell support is quite ugly: <tt>:setlocal spell spelllang=en_gb</tt> Am I supposed to put that in my .muttrc? As it doesn&#8217;t setup automatically when editing mail. Might just stick with aspell for the time being.</p>

<p>Tabs are cool. I&#8217;ll use them. Before I used to split and minimize windows. Kinda ugly really.</p>

<p>I am still desperately looking for something that can close <span class="caps">HTML</span> tags or something that can assist me writing <span class="caps">HTML</span>. Some basic well formedness check would be nice.</p>

<p>:hardcopy looks cool, but it doesn&#8217;t seem to be able to hardcopy Korean letters. Perhaps I am missing some Korean fonts in my postscript path. After peeking at &#8220;postscript-cjk-printing&#8221;, it looks like I need to install some fonts. Argh! How in Debian?</p>

<p>Ok good luck vim7 users.</p>

<p>Update: <br />
 * Undo actually behaves better. I was a little too hasty in my initial tests.<br />
 * Bracket highlighting, nice.</p>
