<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Gillette">Gillette</a> is on my shit list.

<p>Well, the title is misleading. The real problem is incompatible interfaces due to their &#8220;innovative&#8221; upgrades. Gillette have pioneered in razors with 2, 3, 4 and 5 blades. Whatever next!?</p>

<p>Incidentally the price for 5 sensor excel double-blades are 5.5USD in Argentina.</p>

<p>Their newer Mach3 Turbo triple-blade set of 4 (not 5) costs about 8USD. I recall that being a lot cheaper than the UK.</p>
