<p>Since visiting my <a href="http://prazefarm.co.uk/">home in Cornwall</a> after two years of travel, I am back in <a href="http://maps.natalian.org/">travel mode</a> in South America. I&#8217;m in Buenos Aires, studying Spanish and taking in the steak. You <strong>can</strong> cut it with the back of a knife!</p>

<p>This time <a href="http://delaunay.org/antoine/blog/">Antoine</a> isn&#8217;t with me, though <a href="http://twmcat.blogspot.com/">Jamie</a> is.</p>

<p>Ok, blog readers like it short and sweet, so here is a bullet list of my first impressions:</p>

<ul>
<li>cold, wet &amp; windy</li>
<li>dull green landscape</li>
<li>architecture is a bit of a shambles</li>
<li>cross between Russia and Portugal (haven&#8217;t been to Spain for awhile)</li>
<li>police at each corner which makes me nervous. Though they have not troubled me yet.</li>
<li>Shanty towns abound</li>
<li>Quite a big sprawling city</li>
<li>Buses make a strange whistling noise</li>
<li>Lots of dogs (many stray)</li>
<li>Has a subway (somewhat surprising)</li>
<li>People sell things in the train/subway which annoys me</li>
<li>People kiss in public! <span class="caps">GROSS</span>! <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">MEN</span> <span class="caps">KISS</span>. <span class="caps">WTF</span>!</li>
<li>Quite a mix racially. Light to dark native range</li>
<li>Many men are quite well built</li>
<li>Steak, chips with red wine and a tip is about 30 (ARS) pesos. That&#8217;s about 10 <span class="caps">USD</span>!</li>
<li>Things are like they were in the 50s</li>
<li>Breakfast is small, lunch is at 2pm and dinner is at 9pm&#8230; argh!</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#8217;ll probably add to this.</p>
