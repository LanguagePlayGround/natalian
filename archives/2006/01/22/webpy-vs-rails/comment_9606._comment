<p>Looks like your boiling your brains out at the Tennis centre.</p>

<p>&gt; Current versions of web.py didn’t have sqlite, but I hacked in support quickly. <br />
&gt; This is so opposite to my fumbling experiences with Rails…</p>

<p>I&#8217;m just about up to the web.py, db side trying to get mysql to work Could you add a post to &#8216;<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/webpy&#8217">http://groups.google.com/group/webpy&#8217</a>; about how you did this?  I&#8217;m sure a few others might be interested.</p>
