<p>I eventually tried <a href="http://nintendowifi.com.au/">Nintendo Internet play</a> on Saturday morning outside Electronic Boutique in Melbourne central.</p>

<p>At first it couldn&#8217;t organise a game, because it couldn&#8217;t find anyone to play.</p>

<p>Bit disappointing.</p>

<p>After waiting and then retrying I managed to play a couple of Japanese (judging by their names) and a guy called &#8220;Jeremy&#8221;.</p>

<p>It was a bit laggy at times so some tight &#8220;turbo boost&#8221; corners were quite hard to achieve.</p>

<p>So in the end it fealt like I was playing some really good computers, as we couldn&#8217;t chat afterwards. :(</p>

<p>Shame they couldn&#8217;t see my jumping up and down breaking (again) my 5 year old Tevas. I guess I should buy a new pair although I would prefer an Israeli made sandal from a company I&#8217;ve forgotten the name of.</p>

<p>Nintendo should have a system for editing your profiles via browser, so you get to know your enemy better. I tried to put my 13 character email address as my nick. Slightly too long. Doh.</p>
