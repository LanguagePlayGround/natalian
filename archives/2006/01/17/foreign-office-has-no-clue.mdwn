<p>I loathe the <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk">British foreign office</a>. Absolutely hate them.</p>

<p>I am not going to pain myself to recall my experience with them post-tsunami. Today I will just highlight how stupidly they don&#8217;t have the sense to have some sort of standard for naming consulate Web sites.</p>

<p>Just search for <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=british+high+commission">British High Commission</a> to get a taste of all the bizaare names of the consulates.</p>

<ul>
<li>britaus.net for Australia</li>
<li>britainincanada.org for Canada</li>
<li>britain.org.za for South Africa</li>
<li>britishembassy.gov.uk/kazakhstan for Kazakhstan</li>
</ul>

<p>Why not use a sensible <span class="caps">URI</span> structure with a short domain such as <strong>bhc.gov.uk</strong> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Codes">country codes</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://bhc.gov.uk/fi">http://bhc.gov.uk/fi</a> for Finland say</li>
</ul>

<p>This option would make it credible and somewhat guessable what the official site should be. Very sad current situation.</p>
