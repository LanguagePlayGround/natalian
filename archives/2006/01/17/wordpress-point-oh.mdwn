<p>After being hassled about updating <a href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/w/wordpress.html">Wordpress packages</a> to 2.0 I did.</p>

<p>Though I sort of regret it now as I wanted to wait for a bug fix release. &#8220;Point oh&#8221; software keeps me the creeps.</p>

<p>Now a <a href="http://ryan.wordpress.com/2006/01/13/201-in-the-works/">2.0.1 release is in the works</a> that will fix at least one <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=328909">(long standing) minor security issue</a>.</p>

<p>Personally I am reluctant to update Wordpress to 2.0 on my blog <a href="http://natalian.org/">natalian</a>.</p>

<li>I don&#8217;t like the look of the new edit form. </li>
<li>I&#8217;m afraid the plugins I use are going to break.</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t need any more features except perhaps the plugins I use being part of the main trunk and perhaps a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha">Captcha</a></li>
