<p>The new edit form is utterly horrible. Thankfully it&#8217;s optional per-user, so just turn it off and not worry about it.</p>

<p>Most of the plug-ins work fine, there&#8217;s a list of plug-ins on the wordpress wiki that definetly work.</p>

<p>The new askimet plug-in removes the need for captchas et al, you do need a wordpress.com login (free) to get an api key though.</p>
