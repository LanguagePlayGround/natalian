<p>Some of you might have <a href="http://natalian.org/archives/2006/01/18/one-way-travel-in-asia/">guessed I&#8217;m off to Korea</a>. I&#8217;ve tried getting an IT job in Korea, but nothing has materialized. I&#8217;ve never really had a problem getting a job before and since Korea is all <strong>IT</strong> and all, it&#8217;s been a little disappointing.</p>

<p>Anyway, I should have a part time teaching job lined up where I will be teaching young kids with little or no English ability. Oh jeepers. ;)</p>

<p>It&#8217;s only part time, so I guess I&#8217;ll have quite a bit free time to explore Korea and perhaps work on a couple of <a href="http://trac.natalian.org/browser/projects">projects</a> I have in mind.</p>

<p>I have a monster trip ahead of me from tomorrow. Vietnam, Thailand and then Korea. Argh, I hate flying!</p>
