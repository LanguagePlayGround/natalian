<p>Hi Natalian,</p>

<p>I was checking out your site and noticed that you&#8217;re running Trac on Dreamhost&#8230; how did you get it to run? I was looking at this a while ago, but never gave it a go as one of Trac&#8217;s prerequisites is clearsilver &#8211; which I can&#8217;t get on to Dreamhost. Can you give me some tips on how you achieved this?</p>

<p>Nice site by the way, especially the google maps extension.</p>

<p>Cheers,<br />
Harold</p>
