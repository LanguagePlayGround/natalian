<p>Here I&#8217;ll aim to put some silly stats I&#8217;ve picked up from people and newspapers. I&#8217;ll try and verify them, as some of them are hard to believe.</p>

<ul>
<li>Kissing was banned on TV until only 10 years ago</li>
<li>Seoul has the largest metro system <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subways">verified</a> &#8211; though much of it is above ground (cheating!)</li>
<li>Highest (alcohol) drinking for a developed nation</li>
<li>Highest road accidents for a developed nation</li>
<li>Highest broadband penetration <a href="http://adslguide.org.uk/newsarchive.asp?item=2630">2nd to Iceland</a></li>
<li>Seoul is the most populated city <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul">no third most</a></li>
<li>Most homogeneous society (1% are foreigners and many of them are indistinguishable Asians)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some I&#8217;ve made up:</p>

<ul>
<li>Most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_%28electronic%29">spam</a> (their culture seems to tolerate it!) <a href="http://www.spamhaus.org/statistics/countries.lasso">Not true</a> Though you have no idea how much phone spam I get and people sticking flyers to my door!</li>
<li>Least crime &#8211; it is so safe here</li>

<li>Most plastic surgery</li>
<li>Quite a few Christians about (Red crossed out night!)</li>

<li>Most Starcraft watchers &#8211; last night I walked past a <strong>hairdressing salon</strong> to see people glued to the TV watching a multiplayer starcraft game! <span class="caps">HOW</span> <span class="caps">NUTS</span> IS <span class="caps">THAT</span>?</li>
</ul>

<p>&#8220;Developed nation&#8221; statistics are usually compiled by the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</a> and their member countries. Unfortunately their website is terrible as most of the stats are in PDFs and hence completely useless.</p>
