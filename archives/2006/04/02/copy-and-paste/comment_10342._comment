<p>&#8220;The most common and long lasting standard is Ctrl-Insert for ‘Copy’, Shift-Insert for ‘Paste’ and Shift-Delete for ‘Cut’.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, if you&#8217;re selecting text with your mouse in the right hand, and using the keyboard with your left hand to perform the cut/copy/paste actions, ctrl-insert and the like are probably the worst possible shortcut possible (you either have to move your left hand to the right side of the keyboard and contort it or take your right hand off the mouse and use that).  The beauty of Ctrl+x,c,v is that your left hand doesn&#8217;t have to move at all.</p>

<p>Of course since I&#8217;m using a dvorak keyboard, my shortcuts of choice are Ctrl+q,j,k&#8230;</p>
