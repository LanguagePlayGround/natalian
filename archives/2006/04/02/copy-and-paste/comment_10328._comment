<p>I learned the Shift-Insert thing about 15 years ago on Windows. There was no talk of Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V etc back then. In fact, I believe they were copied from Macintosh, where some other key was used instead of Control.</p>

<p>Select-and-middle-click is my primary method of copypasting when not in Emacs.  Yes, it does work in Firefox.  I hate it when some apps handle it poorly (like Openoffice Impress).</p>
