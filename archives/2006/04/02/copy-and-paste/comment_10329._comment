<p>Real Men have keyboards with dedicated buttons for these things. Only weenies waste their middle buttons on pasting.</p>

<p>As for the &#8220;raising click&#8221;: even MacOS is agnostic here. Most every desktop I&#8217;ve used gets this wrong, and there&#8217;s likely some weenie in the <span class="caps">GNOME</span> command chain who objects to fixing this there.</p>
