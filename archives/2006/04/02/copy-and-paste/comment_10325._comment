<p>For someone new to Debian and X, all you should teach them is ctrl-x,c,v. On any modern desktop it work as expected. Don&#8217;t tell them about the selecting and middle-clicking as that will just confuse them and is a legacy/power user feature.</p>

<p>gnome-terminal uses shift-control-v because ctrl-v can used in command-line applications. I&#8217;m guessing reason x/c/v (and z for undo) were chosen (by Apple?) is because they&#8217;re all in the lower left corner and can be easily hit by the left hand holding ctrl (or command).</p>
