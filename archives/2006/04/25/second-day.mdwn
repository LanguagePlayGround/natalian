<p>Yesterday I did the metro and tiananmen square. I can&#8217;t help but compare China to Russia. I asked a Chinese person did Chinese copy Russia or is it the other way around? She replied, &#8220;China copied Russia&#8221;.</p>

<p>The metro is quite disappointing. The trains are quite small and infrequent. I actually dared to go in quite peak times and it didn&#8217;t feel crowded at all. The carriages themselves are small and I had to duck to get into it. I think most people travel on the road by buses and push bikes. It does take a bit of time to go underground and queue up for a stupid piece of paper which you hand to someone as you walk down to the platform. The murals compared to Moscow or Saint Petersburg are also disappointing. I visited a few stations and it was bland, but I guess it was better than seeing hundreds of flashy ads. So it was quite peaceful. You could read a book down there.</p>

<p>Tiananmen square. I can&#8217;t help but compare this again to the Red Square in Moscow. It&#8217;s big, but not as big as I expected it to be somehow. It is also has a little moussaliam for Mao like Lenin. Ok, I admit it is much better than anything in Russia. Funny enough there wasn&#8217;t just Chinese flags on display, but Finnish ones too. <span class="caps">WTF</span>? Finland is haunting me. I asked why the hell are there so many Finnish flags and I was told there must be an official state visit from Finland. Of course.</p>

<p>Incidentally I attended Mobile Monday Beijing last night. Loads of people. Well organised. Once again a whole bunch of Finns. Nokia seem to do alright in China. Trouble is with these sorts of mobile meetings is that there is no point for a technical person like myself to talk to a mobile games salesman. Really. No point. Waste of everyones time. So everyone was there but it was difficult to ascertain who you should speak to, to push your agenda.</p>

<p>The talk theme was about <strong>mobile marketing</strong> which is a bit of a sick joke. First speaker wanted Flash which boiled my blood. Second speaker talked about the millions of people they successfully spam. Last speaker talked about <span class="caps">SMS</span> campaigns. He gave an example for people to text to and funnily people exclaimed it didn&#8217;t work! You see a lot of people there had <span class="caps">CDMA</span> phones which is 2.5G whatever, which weren&#8217;t compatible with the <span class="caps">GSM</span> networks. Oh super great!</p>

<p>The whole mobile industry is so frustrating for me. I couldn&#8217;t help but blurt out how much a Email client or rather good Web browsers would be for everyone. Funnily some people agreed with me, but I think just as a gesture to calm me down.</p>
