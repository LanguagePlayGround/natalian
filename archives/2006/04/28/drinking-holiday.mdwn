<p>Sidenote: I am drunk</p>

<p>Last night was great. I found a massage parlour and had a Chinese style massage for 80RMB for 50 minutes (quite expensive <span class="caps">IMO</span>). This blind (really she was blind) girl was chatting to me in English and she has such a cute oriental accent that sounded like honey to my ears (or what&#8217;s that expression)? The massage itself wasn&#8217;t too amazing. I kind of rate a massage by how much pain you put me in. I prefer Thai style, not so much for the pain, but by how the body is leveraged.</p>

<p>Then I quickly got ready for the &#8220;Freedom celebrations&#8221; to discover my 100% cotton shirt to be horribly creased. Eventually I found a laundry shop that ironed it really well for 2 Juan.</p>

<p>Traffic to the function at the &#8220;China World Hotel&#8221; was horrendous. At times my taxi didn&#8217;t move for 5 minutes. Some of the bus stops I saw on the way were quite amazing. A sea of people. At last I&#8217;m seeing examples of a large population.</p>

<p>The function was <strong>huge</strong>. Much bigger than I was expecting. Usual crap with a completely generic &#8220;Freedom day&#8221; speech from the charmless ambassador. There were some south African dancers who put on a raw performance. Comparing the sophisticated Beijing Opera and our lively African dancers gyrating their bits. Different worlds.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t help feel a little misrepresented as a white south African. I did try talk to several people who I thought looked a little South African. One turned out to be Bangladeshi and another Armenian. I&#8217;m losing my touch. But they and Chinese in general were surprised I (white guy) am from South African.</p>

<p>Another somewhat interesting thing is that South Africa isn&#8217;t the only embassy to have a military attache. I saw glorious military uniforms from several countries on display. Sadly I didn&#8217;t find the South African military official to abuse.</p>

<p>There is this strange &#8220;name card&#8221; game being played here in Beijing, especially by young ambitious girls. I heard the most corniest lines in my life. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t we met before?&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard your voice somewhere&#8230;&#8221;, then the please may I have your name card! Of course, I didn&#8217;t say no.</p>

<p>I did manage to track down some of my kindred, who turned out to be language teachers in Beijing. There were really just 5 of us. 10 if you count the older business people. The wine flowed, though the food wasn&#8217;t that great, so I guess I drunk too much.</p>

<p>We ended up going to another bar in Sanlitun (new embassy area) and I won&#8217;t put you through the details. I eventually got out of bed at 12 to organise a trip to the <strong>Great wall</strong>. Tomorrow is the start of the Chinese holidays so it is going to be a real arse fight I reckon.</p>

<p>So what have I done today? Nothing. I did mean to fly a kite or visit a park. But the kite that I could have flown looked really crap compared to some others I&#8217;ve seen. For lunch I ordered sweet and sour chicken and end up getting these grease balls of an unidentifiable substance covered in a very heavy generic sweet and sour sauce. Last couple of Chinese meals have really sucked!</p>

<p>Beer is quite alright and stupidly cheap here. I&#8217;ve probably mentioned this umpteen times already. 3Juan (0.30 <span class="caps">EUR</span>) for 630ml of ice cold beer from the Hostel bar. That&#8217;s a worthwhile reason for visiting this country alone!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve arranged to meet some Chinese geeks on Tuesday. I&#8217;ve been asked/forced to give a presentation about the webpy Web application anti-framework. Since I don&#8217;t have a computer and I have not written anything substantial with the library it&#8217;s going to be a little tricky. They also suggested I compare it to other Web application frameworks. I just hope there isn&#8217;t a sea of people there. Otherwise this will be very embarrassing.</p>
