<p>My first impressions are good. Though I am feeling like a moron relying too much on the lonely planet.</p>

<p>The Beijing lonely planet sucks as it doesn&#8217;t print place names in Chinese characters. Chinese people simply can&#8217;t read Latin characters. So I&#8217;ve been walking around semi-lost today. The distances are pretty big.</p>

<p>My favourite websites are blocked! <span class="caps">BBC</span> News and Wikipedia, with Gmail being pig slow. Oh well, I figured away around it with the help of Antoine.</p>

<p>The metro seems kind of small compared to Russia, so that was a little disappointing. A lot of people simply ride around on push bikes. I need to get one.</p>

<p>I visited the main train station. Impressive and clean, though there are quite a few people who looked like they&#8217;ve just rocked up to the big bad city from the country. Bamboo poles, big sacks and a bewildered expression. I felt sorry for those people.</p>

<p>I tried to figure out how much is a ticket to Moscow. After queuing for 20 minutes and getting nowhere, I gave up.</p>

<p>The weather is wonderful. I can see the sun. The air is OK, though it often has this &#8220;concrete newly-constructed&#8221; dust smell to it. The smell inside of buildings reminds me a lot of Russia. On second thought this smell is probably used toilet paper, as it can&#8217;t be flushed with soviet style toilets! Though damn, I miss Russia!</p>

<p>I see a lot more European foreigners than in Seoul.</p>

<p>I am going for lunch. I can only order dumplings right now. Though I want something more deep fried, crispy and new.</p>
