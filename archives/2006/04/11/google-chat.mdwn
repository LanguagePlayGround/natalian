<p>Finally after months of waiting, I have Google chat enabled on my Gmail account.</p>

<p>How did that happen?</p>

<p>Did Google eventually roll it out on my account? Nope</p>

<p>Did Google actually post some information after searching for &#8220;chat&#8221; in their help pages? Nope</p>

<p>Did they reply to your email asking what the deal is with Google chat? Nope</p>

<p>Then what? <a href="http://camera.theholybible.co.uk/Australia/index.php?file=dsc_4097.jpg">Jamie</a> told me to change my language from English <strong>UK</strong> to <strong>US</strong>.</p>
