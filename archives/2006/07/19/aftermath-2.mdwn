<p>I didn&#8217;t know whether to laugh or cry with the latest news with regards to <a href="http://natalian.org/archives/2005/01/13/alright-on-andaman/">Tsunamis</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>How 7.3bn <span class="caps">UKP</span> was <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/tsunami/story/0,,1821029,00.html">squandered</a></li>
<li>How the UN&#8217;s early warning systems does <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/indonesia/Story/0,,1823219,00.html">not work</a></li>
</ol>

<p>I&#8217;ve seen with my own eyes stupid scenes where locals would sit around looking on while their homes were replaced by foreign workers and foreign designs. There must be another way to help people than just giving money away like that to naive and corrupt charities.</p>

<p>There must be a way of decentralising a Tsunami warning system. Locals need to rely on themselves, not for a phone call to come down the chain of command. They should set up a community PA system like they have in Japan. I also like to think a lot of people can be saved with education. Telling people to stay well away from the shore after an earthquake and perhaps teaching people to swim.</p>
