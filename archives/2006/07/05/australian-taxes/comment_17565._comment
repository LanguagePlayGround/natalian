<p>a) If you put down that you&#8217;re a resident of Australia it&#8217;s not really surprising that they assume you have an Aussie address and bank account.</p>

<p>b) Australians that work here pay national insurance and tax towards the <span class="caps">NHS</span> like the rest of us. (Except my ex who is still on the tax man&#8217;s back list.)</p>

<p>c) You don&#8217;t have to restart XP after changing the date format.</p>

<p>d) It&#8217;s not the OS&#8217;s fault that the software is sucky.</p>
