<p>So &#8220;Fair Play&#8221; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/5154248.stm"><span class="caps">FIFA</span> award best player to Zinedine Zidane</a>. Yes, <span class="caps">FIFA</span> is still on my shitlist.</p>

<p>So it is time for some post tournament <a href="http://football.guardian.co.uk/worldcup2006/comment/story/0,,1817262,00.html">analysis</a>.</p>

<p>Firstly thanks for everyone who sent emails and left comments regarding my efforts to rebroadcast <a href="http://natalian.org/archives/2006/06/15/bbc-radio-5-live/">Radio 5 during the World cup</a>. Please try put pressure on <span class="caps">FIFA</span> or <span class="caps">BBC</span>, by writing <a href="http://letter.dabase.com/">a letter of complaint</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve enjoyed the world cup, despite having no TV and the 4am kick offs in Korea. By and large I relied on watching the games at my neighbour <a href="http://alanskorea.blogspot.com/2006/07/epilogue_10.html">Alan</a>&#8216;s place.</p>

<p>Of course I was disappointed with the England performance and I&#8217;ve learnt for the umpteenth time that supporting Germany is much more satisfying. I&#8217;ve really enjoyed watching Germany, I think they should have won it. ;)</p>

<p>The next World cup will be in South Africa which is quite exciting. I hope the next tournament exposes South <strong>African</strong> politics &amp; issues. Though sport like some drug makes people forget the real issues at hand. It also makes people go out and buy TVs. Scary.</p>
