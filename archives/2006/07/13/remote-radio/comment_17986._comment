<p>Just bumped on to your blog today in relevance to a post I made too&#8230;<br />
XM Satelite is an insane rip-off mate&#8230;  with a proper shortwave radio and a booster antenna I pick up broadcasts from NZ and OZ from here in NY.  The rig I posted today is solar powered and still top reception&#8230;  I think internet radio is more likely to run shortwave out than paid-subscription satelite&#8230;  but the reliability of shortwave and the quality of information available makes it worth it&#8230;<br />
Nice blog!  I&#8217;ll check back!<br />
