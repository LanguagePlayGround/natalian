<p>Sometime ago I came up with the idea of automated comparison of how different Office applications render Microsoft documents. Here is some output and thoughts.</p>

<p># Export test file to <span class="caps">PDF</span> from application<br />
 # `convert` (imagemagick) <span class="caps">PDF</span> to <span class="caps">TIFF</span><br />
 # <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/graphics/findimagedupes">findimagedupes</a> $MICROSOFT_TIFF $COMPETITOR_TIFF</p>

<pre>
office2007beta2/4-1-1-23.tiff abiword/4-1-1-23.tiff:  89.45% similar.
office2007beta2/2-19-1-1.tiff freepdfconvert/2-19-1-1.tiff:  98.44% similar.
office2007beta2/2-19-14-7.tiff freepdfconvert/2-19-14-7.tiff:  99.61% similar.
office2007beta2/4-1-1-23.tiff freepdfconvert/4-1-1-23.tiff:  96.48% similar.
office2007beta2/2-19-1-1.tiff neevia/2-19-1-1.tiff:  98.44% similar.
office2007beta2/2-19-14-7.tiff neevia/2-19-14-7.tiff:  99.61% similar.
office2007beta2/4-1-1-23.tiff neevia/4-1-1-23.tiff:  94.92% similar.
office2007beta2/2-19-1-1.tiff OO/2-19-1-1.tiff:  91.80% similar.
office2007beta2/2-19-14-7.tiff OO/2-19-14-7.tiff:  99.22% similar.
office2007beta2/4-1-1-23.tiff OO/4-1-1-23.tiff:  88.28% similar.

<p># Abiword 2.4.4 failed to generate PDFs that imagemagick&#8217;s convert could work on, except in one case. Btw the rendering in that case is completely <strong>wrong</strong>. Notice though how it scored a 89.45% similarity.<br />
 # Chart <span class="caps">PDF</span> test files that MSOffice2007beta2 outputted would make imagemagick&#8217;s convert choke ! :( Hence, I had to compare them by hand. <br />
 # <a href="http://neevia.com">Neevia</a> and <a href="http://www.freepdfconvert.com/">freepdfconvert</a> do very high quality <span class="caps">PDF</span> conversion compared to MS Office 2007.<br />
 # Converting test files to <span class="caps">PDF</span> in each application is <strong>extremely laborious</strong><br />
 # OpenOffice 2.0.3 does well, except minor details in the rendering such as font size and alignment<br />
 # I did try <a href="http://www.pdfonline.com/">other</a> &#8220;online&#8221; <span class="caps">PDF</span> convertors. Neevia and freepdfconvert were the only two to pass my basic <span class="caps">CJK</span> test.<br />
 # <a href="http://qa.openoffice.org/servlets/ReadMsg?listName=dev&amp;msgNo=6512">Reference <span class="caps">PDF</span> conversion with OO can be automated</a><br />
 # Of course I assume that the <span class="caps">PDF</span> export is the same as the on screen rendering. This isn&#8217;t strictly true. For example Word documents with a coloured background won&#8217;t come out in a <span class="caps">PDF</span>.<br />
 # Imagemagick&#8217;s compare and <a href="http://pdiff.sourceforge.net/">pdiff</a> can help<br />
 # I tried <a href="http://www.softmaker.com/english/tml_en.htm">Softmaker&#8217;s Textmaker 2002 linux edition.</a> Couldn&#8217;t render any of my doc tests. The new 2006 Textmaker version for Windows renders my tests well, though it seems unable to export to <span class="caps">PDF</span>. Doh!<br />
 # <a href="http://www.livingwithoutmicrosoft.org/2006/06/04/pdf-in-ms-office/">Microsoft are doing away with <span class="caps">PDF</span> export</a><br />
 # The similarity index can only be used as a rough guide to flag possible problems. OO renderings are often below 90%, but the information is there.</p>

<p>If there is a way to hack Microsoft Office 2007beta2 to create (correct) PDFs from them command (cmd) line, then this technique has a hope. I can&#8217;t be bothered to go through hundreds of test cases. Since Neevia and &#8220;freepdfconvert&#8221; are so close to Microsoft Office2007 renderings in my tests, perhaps they could be used as a base reference.</p>
