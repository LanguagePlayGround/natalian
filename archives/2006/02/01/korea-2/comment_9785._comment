<p>Gadgets!</p>

<ul>
<li>I need to burn damn ubuntu CDs and such things. Argh, I don&#8217;t want to buy a CD recorder, but I might have to</li>
<li>New hard drive. Can I install a new Seagate 160GB in my T30? Else I&#8217;ll need an external casing and it will be slow with USB1&#8230;</li>
<li>I need a <span class="caps">USB</span> key that I can easily pocket. They are soooo useful. And it would be great if it could play mp3s, flacs and the rest of it&#8230; I wonder if I get it booting an OS?</li>
</ul>
