<p>I&#8217;d strongly recommend going with <span class="caps">LTSP</span> and Ubuntu or Debian.  Get a beefy central server, (maybe 1 gig ram for 10 clients) and set up a thin-client network.  Then, all the computers are like the central server, and it is very easy to manage&#8230;<br />
Please email me if you are interested in how to set it up, I&#8217;ve done it several times.</p>
