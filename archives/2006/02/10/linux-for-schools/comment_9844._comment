<p>I was thinking that ebox (<a href="http://www.ebox-platform.com/index">http://www.ebox-platform.com/index</a>) would be a good solution for schools. All it needs is a little documentation. It is much simpler than scolelinux, and possibly more powerful. Its Debian-based, and there is even a live CD to try.</p>
