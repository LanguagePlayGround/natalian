<p>Actually I found out today that Ipods aren&#8217;t that expensive and they have quite a large market share of the MP3 player market nowadays.</p>

<p>2G Ipod nanos can be found for 190USD and on the Apple website they sell them currently for 200USD. I asked a Korean why are they quite cheap and he said because they use Samsung memory.</p>

<p>Though Macbook Pros are still quite expensive. I guess they are taxed differently or something. For example the current 2000USD version is 2340USD here.</p>
