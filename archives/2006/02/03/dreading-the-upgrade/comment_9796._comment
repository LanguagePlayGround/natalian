<p>I think it is passe to have seperate partitions for swap with <span class="caps">LVM</span> in mind.</p>

<p>Copying from root doesn&#8217;t work in my exp because of that proc madness. Though that sounds like a reasonable approach. I just don&#8217;t want the hassle of creating partitions, installing a boot loader and fiddling with the fstab.</p>

<p>And just want to copy whatever I have in A to B. :)</p>
