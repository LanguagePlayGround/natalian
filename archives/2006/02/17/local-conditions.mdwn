<p>So <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/02/testimony-internet-in-china.html">Google argue their place in the Chinese market</a> by saying:</p>

<ol>
<li>We&#8217;re <strong>expanding</strong> access to information</li>
<li>We&#8217;re respecting local conditions</li>
</ol>

<p>Firstly, you&#8217;re <strong>expanding biased information</strong>. If you don&#8217;t have access to all the facts, what do you have? You might have more facts about flowers and animals, but if you don&#8217;t have access to different viewpoints about your oppressive government, how the hell are you supposed to take control of your life?</p>

<p>I grew up in Apartheid South Africa. Trust me, I know that <strong>not printing</strong> some news is as <strong>dangerous</strong> as torturous propaganda.</p>

<p>Secondly, local conditions. Don&#8217;t take the piss out of the Internet. The first thing I loved about the Internet is that it is Global and borderless la lala laa. &#8220;Respecting local conditions&#8221; pisses on that notion. I really believe governments should never dare try censor the Internet. I know about that German law and it&#8217;s a travesty.</p>

<p>Later they argue that they looking out for the interest of users. How would they know? Honestly! Another clever piece of rhetoric in the beginning &#8220;certainly don&#8217;t – my colleagues certainly don&#8217;t – expect everyone to agree with our decision&#8221; isn&#8217;t expanded on. It would have been better to outlay the risks of supporting censorship and why this is (as they put it) a decision to be disagreed upon.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China">China</a> is fascinating. I enjoyed read <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/18">Mark&#8217;s post about China.</a> Though China is extremely dangerous if it can manipulate 1 billion of it&#8217;s proud inhabitants.</p>
