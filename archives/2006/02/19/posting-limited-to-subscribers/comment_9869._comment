> I have set envelope_from=yes in my .muttrc                                                                     
                                                                                                                 
  Ok.                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                 
> Thanks. I think another problem is my FROM: is usually hendry@iki.fi and                                       
> not hendry@dabase.com.                                                                                         
                                                                                                                 
  In that case, with mutt's envelope_from=yes, your return-path is being                                         
  set to hendry@iki.fi. If what you say is that you want to use @iki in                                          
  From, but @dabase as Return-Path:                                                                              
                                                                                                                 
    mutt from sid: set envelope_from envelope_from_address=hendry@dabase.com                                     
    previous mutt: set envelope_from=no sendmail='/usr/lib/sendmail -oem -oi -f hendry@dabase.com'               
                                                                                                                 
  This, for lists that allow you to use whatever From you want, but                                              
  force you an specific Return-Path.                                                                             
                                                                                                                 
> Sending up a hook to change to hendry@dabase.com for list traffic                                              
> doesn't sound possible. Or is it?                                                                              
                                                                                                                 
  Depending on your taste, since all of @iki ends up in @dabase anyway,                                          
  you can use the avobe snippet for all your outgoing mail. If you feel                                          
  like being picky, then yes, you could use a hook to set it only for                                            
  list mail.                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                 
  Again, HTH,
