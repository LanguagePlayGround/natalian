<p>As I can never find a library, nevermind mind one with English books, I like many other natives of Southern America, have to buy books. To avoid expense, they tend to be found in second hand book stores.</p>

<p>The one thing that strikes me is the large collection of second hand magazines they have. This is especially true in Brazil. Many maintain a remarkable second hand porn collection.</p>

<p>More than often there is a pitiful collection of books. Here are my observations from one store across the road from my fine hotel Gloria in Blumenau:</p>

<ul>
<li>Inside Linda Lovelace &#8211; worn paperback and I can only assume intresting to porn fans</li>
<li>KungFu p.3 &#8211; I really do not understand how people expect to learn martial arts from a barely illustrated paperback such as this</li>
<li>The role of cholesterol in Atherosclerosis &#8211; a specialist book probably stolen from some specialist book shelf</li>
<li>A ton of romantic, spy/crime and conspiracy novels &#8211; every from &#8220;little miss murder&#8221; to &#8220;the untold truth of the thirld world war&#8221;</li>
<li>Since this is a foreign country there is a few books about &#8220;correct english&#8221; &amp; business English and if one is lucky, one can find native notes in the English books, where the reader obviously painstakingly read with the help of a dictionary</li>
<li>The man with a golden arm</li>
<li>The bad blonde</li>
<li>A guide to youth hostels around the world 1984/85 &#8211; How can this possibly be still useful?</li>
<li>Fortune telling by playing cards</li>
<li>Successful living type books. Many seem to suggest joining some Chrisitan church. Sigh&#8230;</li>
</ul>

<p>I did actually find one classic I have not read before. A worn paperback of Jamaica Inn by Daphne du Maurier for 1USD. Jamaica Inn itself is just a few miles from my family&#8217;s home in England.</p>
