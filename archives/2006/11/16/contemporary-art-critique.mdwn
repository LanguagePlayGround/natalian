<p>Instead of hopelessly waiting at the hostel for news about my work visa or my Thinkpad&#8217;s hard drive replacement, I followed friends&#8217; advice to visit the Fundação <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bienal_de_S%C3%A3o_Paulo">Bienal</a> de São Paulo, a contemporary art museum in São Paulo, Brazil.</p>

<p>So begins my <span class="caps">OTT</span> rant about contemporary art. Btw my idea of contemporary art is probably the late <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene">demoscene</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>no reasoning, no explanation, no arguing, no evidence, no science in the descriptions.</li>
<li>usually one artist. art should be a collaborative <span class="caps">IMO</span></li>
<li>no mention of inspirations or credits of other art/artists</li>
<li>descriptions name dropped &#8220;social studies and experiments&#8221;. my ass.</li>
<li>no email address on descriptions, so how on earth do I provide feedback? there is <strong>no feedback</strong> or discussion</li>
<li>big museum and very tiring walking around. It is also is not very clear how to move around the place, so it can be frustrating and disorientating. Is that intended?</li>
<li>space wasting exhibits of videos or photos (80% of exhibits). I&#8217;d rather sit on my computer and watch videos and photographs, thank you!</li>
<li>characteristically some of the &#8220;art&#8221; is shocking or sexually suggestive. it is boring. move on. how many times must I view some exhibit about some child prostitute. Enough already, I AM <span class="caps">BORED</span>.</li>
<li>the art isn&#8217;t exactly Brazilian. I have seen the same dull art in any contemporary art museum the world over. honestly.</li>
<li>I had a feeling there was just no new ideas. Very sad.</li>
<li>I wonder who I had to screw to get my art in there. The clique art community no doubt dominates this scene, judging by the monotony of it all.</li>
<li>I would love to meet a contemporary artist who I thought was smart. It is like a new age bullshit hippie scene.</li>
<li>art should be representative <span class="caps">IMO</span>. What does this stuff represent? Several schools of kids came through there and I can&#8217;t see how many of them made a connection with any of the exhibits.</li>
<li>though some art were silly little activities for kids like a slide and little walkway. completely unoriginal and uninspiring. kids should go to theme park rather.</li>
</ul>

<p>One thing I have noticed is how many people seem to take photos of exhibits. Obviously people seem to want to share or discuss some of this stuff&#8230; now I wonder where.</p>
