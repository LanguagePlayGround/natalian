<p>Yesterday I met a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilates">Pilates</a> instructor who claimed that Pilates is a <strong>scientific</strong> method.</p>

<p>Now I can not find any published scientific medical papers verifying this, can you? I did notice a couple of paperbacks, but that is hardly legitimate.</p>

<p>I will claim Pilates is just another <strong>fad exercise</strong>, unless someone can prove me wrong.</p>
