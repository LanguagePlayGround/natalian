<p>But your x40 is what, one year old?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m always plotting what to purchase once my low-end laptop gives up (or when I&#8217;m totally fed up with its noisy fan! Geez!), and mostly I just end up compiling lists of brands I <b>don&#8217;t</b> want to have. But recently I&#8217;ve been considering an x60. Hence my interest.</p>
