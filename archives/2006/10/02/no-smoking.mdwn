<p>One of my many <a href="http://natalian.org/archives/2006/09/05/argentina/">complaints about Argentina</a> is how they love to smoke.</p>

<p>Earlier I read in disbelief <a href="http://uoeggi.blogspot.com/2006/09/no-smoking.html">a new friend&#8217;s blog entry how they are going prohibit smoking.</a></p>

<p>Last night (30/9), late in the local, a English pub called &#8220;Gilbratar&#8221; in San Telmo I was wondering why it was such a  pleasant atmosphere. The new law silently came in effect from that midnight! A couple of girls with us were told to stop smoking. I couldn&#8217;t believe it.</p>
