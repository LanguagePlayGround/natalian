<p>Btw I&#8217;ve gone off reStructuredText. I am now a big <span class="caps">HTML</span> and <a href="http://www.princexml.com/">http://www.princexml.com/</a> fanboy. :)</p>

<p>Anyway I know for a fact Google docs does not actually any of the aforementioned formats to store their documents. Though their main language is really the Web. Ah, <span class="caps">HTML</span> again.</p>

<p>I reckon this Web thing could be big. ;)</p>
