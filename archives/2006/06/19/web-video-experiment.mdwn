<p>I am thinking of publishing 3 minute videos on this blog everyday for a week.</p>

<p>In Web 2.0 speak I think this means my <a href="http://natalian.org">blog</a> becomes a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlog">vlog</a> aka Video blogging or Video-casting. Ho ho ho ha.</p>

<p>One such example is <a href="http://www.rocketboom.com/vlog/">this vlog</a> which I&#8217;ve never got working in on my Debian system. But I think it is a vlog that does 3 minute videos everyday and I like that idea.</p>

<p><a href="http://natalian.org/archives/2006/05/28/canon-ixus800is/">I have the technology</a> to do this.</p>

<p>Though I&#8217;m perhaps lacking a little in the <a href="http://openmovieeditor.sourceforge.net/HomePage">editing tools</a> and video expertise. Of course, I&#8217;ll use no &#8220;proprietary&#8221; tools.</p>

<p>I think it will be a bit of show and tell format with a boring News desk type setup from my little apartment.</p>

<p>Though I also need some topics to talk about. So if people can suggest anything. Let me know.</p>
