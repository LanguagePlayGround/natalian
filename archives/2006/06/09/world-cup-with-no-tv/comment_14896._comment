<p>Actually I think <span class="caps">BBC</span> is smart enough to change to right version based on IP.</p>

<p>I tested the CCproxy and Win32 Realplayer last night and <strong>it works</strong>!</p>

<p>Now the problem I still face is getting Linux realplayer working properly.</p>

<p>I think I might try setup <a href="http://icecast.org/">http://icecast.org/</a> and get it re-encode the Realplayer stream into some sensible format like <span class="caps">OGG</span>.</p>
