<p>I am trying to work out how the hell to get 5live in Seoul.</p>

<p>I\&#8216;ve only just discovered I don\&#8216;t have to use the rediculously shit realplayer client. I can use mplayer <span class="caps">CLI</span>! Yahoooo! Except I need to find an open UK proxy now. Help.</p>

<p>sam$ mplayer http_proxy://${OPEN_UK_PROXY}/rtsp://rmlivev8.bbc.net.uk/farm/*/ev7/live24/radio5/live/r5_tl_int_g2.ra</p>
