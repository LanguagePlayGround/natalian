<p>It is sad outfits like this have sprung up. Charging 90USD for a service <span class="caps">BBC</span> should normally provide. It also looks really dodgy. What are the guarantees you&#8217;ll receive service from this Russian outfit?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m providing a free service as a protest of <span class="caps">BBC</span>&#8216;s policy to limit Internet coverage to the UK. The Internet should never be geographically limited.</p>
