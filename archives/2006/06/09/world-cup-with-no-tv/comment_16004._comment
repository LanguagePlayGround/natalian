<p>Hi all,<br />
just found this site after googling &#8220;live audio streaming world cup&#8221;. I&#8217;m a Brit in the US and would love to hear the 5 live on my mac at work. I&#8217;m not super-computer-friendly, though. Could someone tell me how I can use this get-around that you guys are talking about, please? Thanks.</p>
