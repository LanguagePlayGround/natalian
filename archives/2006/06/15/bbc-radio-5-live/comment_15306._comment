<p>Yeah&#8230;Thanks a lot! This is great&#8230;..at least potentially. Does anyone else have the problem that the 5live stream doesn&#8217;t run at normal speed? I have a <span class="caps">DVD</span> recorder so the 2 minute delay is no problem but once I&#8217;ve synced the audio stream with the pictures from my TV in Japan, it goes out of sync again. Everyone&#8217;s voice sounds deep and slowed down. Any ideas why or how to fix this? I&#8217;ve tried both <span class="caps">VLC</span> and WinAmp with no joy. Thanks for your efforts this far though. Great work.</p>

<p>Up the En-ger-land! Kendalbren.</p>
