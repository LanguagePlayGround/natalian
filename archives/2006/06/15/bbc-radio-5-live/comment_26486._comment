<p>i have repeatedly tried to listen to live commentry on radio5 live via internet but i keep getting this stupid message saying that i can only listen if im in the uk ! if i was in the uk i wouldnt be listening to the match i would be watching it on Sky ! But you cannot get Sky in Greece ! ( if you do it is illegal ) so please help us x- pats abroad &amp; lift the copyright on the matches ? at the end of the day music is copyrighted ! and is widely available on the net ! ( legally &amp; illegally ) so why not a pay scheme to listen at home like Sky ? at the end of the day its a commentary its not music losing thousands of pounds of business ? the match only happens once &amp; then its history ?? thankyou for taking your time to listen &amp; hopefully act on this ? johnnie boy! <a href="mailto:discofrenzy@hotmail.com">discofrenzy@hotmail.com</a> living in Greece i look forward to a reply ? thanks<br />

mr john roberts<br />
Country: Greece<br />
Europe<br />
UK postcode:<br />

<p>the only other way is if you have a satellite receiver on astra 28 degrees east you can get the stream from there then re-stream it on the net with a fast connection with only about 1 second delay ? ( but this would be illegal !)</p>

<p>im looking around now for a cheap 2nd hand dvb box for myself just for the stream</p>

<p>if i succeed i will post again here with details of the stream&#8230;...</p>

<p>johnnie boy!  ( or if someone else has the equipment to do it let me know on this board! )</p>
