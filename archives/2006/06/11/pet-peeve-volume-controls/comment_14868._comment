<p>Ok, to put this in layman&#8217;s terms: If my master volume control is up and on, I expect sound playback on an application.</p>

<p>Its not so much applications change the master volume. It&#8217;s the way each individual volume control on an application undermines the master volume control.</p>

<p>I know what next you&#8217;re going to say, but then you can&#8217;t mix two audio streams or something. I don&#8217;t care about mixing at this point.</p>

<p>Also a better implementation of the master volume control applet should be able to control each individual application&#8217;s sound. And perhaps indicate indicate if a particular program&#8217;s volume is muted from the centralised &#8220;master volume&#8221; control panel.</p>

<p>Not even Windows gets this right.</p>
