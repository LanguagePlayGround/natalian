<p>Since I see High Definition (HD) printed on the top right of World cup coverage, I wonder if it means anything.</p>

<p>(Previously I always thought it meant Hard Drive)</p>

<p>A closer inspection of the TV image doesn&#8217;t impress me. When I asked around about <strong>HD</strong> I eventually was told by someone that you need a &#8220;special aerial&#8221;. Which most people don&#8217;t have. I am not sure if the TVs have to be &#8220;special&#8221; too either. In either case the <strong>HD</strong> symbol is printed, which is misleading. So how does one know they&#8217;re actually get High Definition playback? I guess I need to go to a TV store. ;)</p>

<p>Is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVB"><span class="caps">DVB</span></a> High Definition?</p>

<p>Is High Definition all that much better than a good analogue signal and a good monitor?</p>

<p>With the industry pushing BlueRay or HD-DVD, touting &#8220;High Definition&#8221;, I am wondering if they really think people will care or notice. Almost everyone I know is familiar with <span class="caps">DVD</span>-rip, telesync and screener qualities. Most people are perfectly happy with <span class="caps">VCD</span> quality in Asia. I don&#8217;t hear anyone yearning for anything better than <span class="caps">DVD</span>.</p>

<p>I for one would like to see CD media disappear altogether. This is how the latest HD (Hard Drive in this case) cam corders from <span class="caps">JVC</span> are marketed!</p>

<p>Sidenote: That 5.1 Dolby sound often associated with <span class="caps">DVD</span> is also stupid. Most people hate having 5.1 speakers. Don&#8217;t get me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widescreen#Criticism_of_widescreen">started about the stupidity of <strong>widescreen</strong></a>.</p>

<p>I hope the industry wises up a little.</p>
