<p>Just visited the <a href="http://www.fifa.com"><span class="caps">FIFA</span></a> website to be presented with:</p>

<p><a href="http://alanskorea.blogspot.com/">Alan</a> tipped me that <span class="caps">FIFA</span> has blocked access from Korean IP addresses due to so many complaints from Koreans. For those who weren&#8217;t watching Korea&#8217;s last game in World Cup &#8216;06. There was a dubious penalty decision that didn&#8217;t go Korea&#8217;s way against Switzerland.</p>

<p>I am more concerned that <span class="caps">FIFA</span> think the best way of handling this situation is to block access to their Website. <span class="caps">FIFA</span> is firmly on my shitlist.</p>
