<p>Statutes</p>

<p><span class="caps">FIFA</span>’s opposition to any form of discrimination is so firm that the topic deserves a specific article in the organisation’s statutes.</p>

<p>Article 3 (&#8220;Non-discrimination and stance against racism&#8221;) in the general provisions states: &#8221; Discrimination of any kind against a country, private person or groups of people on account of ethnic origin, gender, language, religion, politics or any other reason is strictly prohibited and punishable by suspension or expulsion.&#8221;</p>
