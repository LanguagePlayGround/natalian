<p>I just had a disturbing thought after submitting this <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Labs-Google-Video/browse_thread/thread/0d79a496a8405f3e/6f6f40c693529238?lnk=arm#6f6f40c693529238" rel="nofollow">Google Video thread</a>.</p>

<p>Since <span class="caps">VLC</span> seems to be hopeless at streaming video, you need to use something like Youtube/Google&#8217;s Flash based embedded player to relay your Web videos.</p>

<p>That means you need to upload your video to Google/Yahoo/Youtube. That sucks. I simply want Google or any other search engine to index my video content over at static.natalian.org. Ok, perhaps not &#8220;index&#8221; as its very difficult for a machine to know what this video is about. But at least make it easier to view and access the content.</p>

<p>Uploading content to Google Video or Base is just <strong>stupid</strong>. You are helping create a walled garden of an Internet.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t like it how my mail is held by Google. My images by Flickr. And possibly my videos by Youtube. That&#8217;s just <span class="caps">INSANE</span>. Hosting costs are very cheap. For 10USD a month you can easily host your own personal digital content.</p>

<p>But when the commercial options offer just a little better solutions, do I need to completely sell out? I hope not. Really I do.</p>
