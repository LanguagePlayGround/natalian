<p>I wrote some <a href="http://trac.natalian.org/browser/projects/static">bash tools to assist uploading and maintaining a Web static file repository.</a></p>

<p>This should be useful to anyone who has a bunch of public files he/she wants to share day by day, that might not fit into existing solutions like Flickr. For example, I intend on uploading my videos to static.</p>

<p>So <a href="http://static.natalian.org/">static.natalian.org</a> now has a <a href="http://static.natalian.org/latest.rss">feed of my latest uploads.</a></p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
