<p>Since I consider this blog to be also about Korea, here&#8217;s something about Korea:</p>

<ul>
<li>My indigestion is b0rked. Korean food is spicy, salty and I am having difficulty digesting it</li>
<li>Korean girls my age only think of marriage. Quite crazy.</li>
<li>Shopping for my waist size 34&#8211;36W isn&#8217;t easy. It&#8217;s also very expensive. I think I am going to go to a tailor and get a suit made up. Else try Internet shopping. Grrr.</li>
<li><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/juttahendry/114416728/">Public toilets are quite good in Seoul.</a></li>
<li>Delivered food is very popular. They also pick up the dishes. I don&#8217;t like it as I can&#8217;t order in Korean over the phone and the insane motorcycle delivery guys are all over the sidewalk.</li>
<li>There is a lot of &#8220;spam&#8221;, like people sticking delivery food advertisements on my door. I also get a lot of strange text messages and calls on my mobile. People also sell annoying stuff on the subway. I find this direct marketing a bit wrong.</li>
<li>The mobile phone software is this country <strong>sucks</strong>. Sadly, Nokia pulled out of this market.</li>
<li>Everyone gets up super late here. I go to my local &#8220;Paris Baguette&#8221; bakery and their french sticks aren&#8217;t ready until noon. <span class="caps">WTF</span>? I can&#8217;t wait until noon for breakfast bread.</li>
<li>The gap between rich and poor seems quite large here in my opinion.</li>
<li>Everyone is hooked on Windows, Internet Explorer and ActiveX</li>
<li>People have been glued to baseball this last week. I think they beat <span class="caps">USA</span> and Japan.</li>
<li>The weather sucks</li>
<li>North Korea is a little worrying. The artillery range is more than 100km and Seoul would be screwed within 6hours of an outbreak of war I&#8217;ve been told by an American intelligence officer.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the bright side I had fun at the nearby <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4dvrCP_dig">Seoul Arts campus</a> thing.</p>
