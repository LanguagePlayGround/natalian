<p>I&#8217;ve been installing a couple of machines with operating systems and a common question is where you are for the locale settings. When it says:</p>

<ul>
<li>North Korea</li>
<li>South Korea</li>
</ul>

<p>That&#8217;s easy. I&#8217;m in South Korea. Though Seoul is actually in the middle of the country.</p>

<p>When it says:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Korea">Republic of Korea</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea_%28Democratic_Republic_of%29">Democratic Republic of Korea</a></li>
</ul>

<p>That&#8217;s not so easy. Without being too pedantic, I currently live in RoK, that is just the Republic of Korea.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve found out where the geeks live here in Korea (South, not North). Over at the <a href="http://www.kldp.org/" title="KLDP">Korean Linux Documentation Project</a></p>
