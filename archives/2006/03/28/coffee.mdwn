<p>Coffee (or tea) is ludicrously expensive here in Seoul. Typically four and half <span class="caps">USD</span>, perhaps 5USD.</p>

<p>In Korea 5USD could buy a large meal, so it&#8217;s totally out of proportion.</p>

<p>I used to think 2.5AUD for a coffee was expensive in Melbourne!</p>

<p>They also do not serve you the coffee. They have to boom with the PA systen over the coffee house environment to announce your Latte is ready.</p>

<p>Scandalous.</p>
