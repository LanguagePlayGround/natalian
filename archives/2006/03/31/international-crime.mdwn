<p>I read <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/"><span class="caps">BBC</span> News</a> everyday. I noticed with interest the way they reported that suspicious <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/europe/2001/yugoslavia_after_milosevic/default.stm">Slobodan Milosevic</a> death.</p>

<p>My concerns:</p>

<ul>
<li>First off his death was a bit weird</li>
<li>How long was he on trial at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court"><span class="caps">ICC</span></a> !?</li>
<li>How much did the <span class="caps">ICC</span> cost the tax paper with its highly trained &#8220;International lawyers&#8221;?</li>
<li>Funny how <span class="caps">BBC</span> reported how Milosevic support was down to the &#8220;faithful few&#8221; and later it turns out  thousands turn out for this ex-leader!</li>
</ul>

<p>So hot damn! The <span class="caps">ICC</span>&#8216;s poster boy is dead. As you can see I am pretty biased against the <span class="caps">ICC</span>, since they do echo the farcical &#8220;justice&#8221; displayed in the politically motivated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_trials">Nuremberg trials.</a></p>

<p>I always thought that justice could somehow be dealt with domestically. So you were ruled by Hitler. Once he&#8217;s been overthrown, can&#8217;t you just deal with him at home? Hmmm, it&#8217;s hard to be civil, isn&#8217;t it? For example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Trial">Saddam&#8217;s trial</a> is turning out to be a complete fuck up of a &#8220;domestically tried case&#8221;.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the <span class="caps">ICC</span>. They need a war criminal quick! Let&#8217;s round up <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4860976.stm">Mr Taylor</a> and get him to the Hague and keep some lawyers employed.</p>

<p>Crazy world we live in.</p>
