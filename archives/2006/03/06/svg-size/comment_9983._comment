<p>Keeping your data in <span class="caps">XML</span>? Are you nuts? I would just generate the <span class="caps">SVG</span> from a DB or something. :)</p>

<p>What is the tool to create the <span class="caps">PDF</span> from <span class="caps">HTML</span> with <span class="caps">SVG</span> inline called?</p>
