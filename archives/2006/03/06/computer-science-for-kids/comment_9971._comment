<p>Joshua: Kids play RPGs online with their friends. These games are run by quite large companies which no doubt frown upon a ten year trying to modify (or &#8220;cheat&#8221;) the game! So the kid is literally stuck in that fantasy world, trying to impress your friends by spending hours searching for some artifact.</p>

<p>Joshua: Most Free Software games I&#8217;ve seen, suck big time.</p>

<p>Mark: That Lego Mindstorms stuff looks <span class="caps">COOL</span>, but a little expensive for kids here&#8230; That goes on to one issue I&#8217;m worried about. The equipment. I would like every kid to have an X40, because I know it runs Linux and Plan9. But really that is too expensive. And the graphics/sound sucks. Bring back the 68k Amiga someone. ;)</p>

<p>Mark: I learnt lisp with DrScheme in University. I found it be a little like crack and much preferred a hard broken environment, such as Unix, vi and C. For some reason DrScheme wasn&#8217;t solving my problems at the time. I still look back on my lisp affectionately, though I feel a little uncomfortable teaching it.</p>

<p>Paul: Introducing kids to the demoscene will be difficult. Will they bite the hook? Most demos are a bitch to get running. About 0.2% of demos might run on a free software platform&#8230; A telnet <span class="caps">BBS</span>? Kids won&#8217;t like that, surely. :)</p>

<p>When I am thinking about Computer Science and look at the books on the subject, I feel a little out my depth. Perhaps I am not really a &#8220;computer scientist&#8221;. The stereotypical greybeard language nazi of an unwashed computer scientist seems far far away from my python/web tinkering. ;)</p>
