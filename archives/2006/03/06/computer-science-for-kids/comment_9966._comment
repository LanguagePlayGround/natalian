<p>Nahnah, see, it is the everyday side and then the creative edge of technology that you need to introduce them to. <span class="caps">LAN</span> and demos are exactly the things that taught us about networking and programming. Only don&#8217;t start programming too early. Have them start with easy but useful hard/software skills such as installing a <span class="caps">DVD</span>-ROM drive, playing with the <span class="caps">BIOS</span>, setting up a <span class="caps">LAN</span> or Internet connection. Then at 13 or so have them try out a low-threshold Linux distribution, set up a telnet <span class="caps">BBS</span>, and teach them respect for demos and their production process. If a kid is whizz-compatible, he will take up the challenge of looking into the details of demo production himself, or of playing in textmode Linux. Or of leeching pr0n.</p>

<p>Age needs to be taken into account, of course. Schools nowadays are full of &#8220;playful learning&#8221; ideals with software to match, but I doubt that the kids are interested. Again, some people simply aren&#8217;t of the tech kind, and they shouldn&#8217;t be forced beyond the &#8220;playful learning.&#8221; But if you get a select group, there&#8217;s lots you can do&#8212;but by all means start with something playful when they are about 7 or 8 (depending on their reading/writing skillz0rs). First thing I learned was of the &#8220;a:&#8221; , &#8220;cars.exe&#8221; kind.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure what to do with game addictions. My parents set limits, which I then merrily transgressed. In retrospect it feels like time wasted&#8212;I was an avid reader before I got full access to a computer, and I could have used my time so much better reading books. Hell, I might have been an actual knowledgeable person if I had 8)</p>
