<p>hendry: Free OSs are the next step. Don&#8217;t try to preach the gospel to these kids (alright, I admit it: my telnet suggestion was preaching the gospel, too). What needs to be done first is give them a good functional understanding of the most common systems. That might be Linux in the case of <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/11/17/one_laptop_per_child.html" rel="nofollow">the $100 laptop programme</a>, but in lands where computers are common household items one would have to go with the Redmond status quo.</p>

<p>As for kids taking the bait, it was demos that led me to buy a Turbo Pascal guide while still in primary school. Sure, it didn&#8217;t work out because it was written for experienced, grown-up autodidacts,  and because I never was very good at the exact sciences to begin with. But the spur was there, in the form of them Da Jormas et al. But you&#8217;re right that there&#8217;s not the universal demo platform standard that existed in our time. No sense in sending these poor lads back in time, either.</p>
