<p>I guess it all depends on who it is, but it certainly would be worthwhile to teach a child about programming. I tried to program when I was 8 or 9 years old, but I barely knew English, so even if I had one <span class="caps">BASIC</span> manual I could never get stuff done. I copied code from books and papers, but if I had made a syntax error, I rarely knew what was wrong. It would have helped a lot with a teacher, but all the older people around me, they only knew that a computer was that thing I had been nagging them about for years until they bought it. I am glad they bought me a Commodore 64 and not a Nintendo <span class="caps">NES</span> that I had also considered.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t until I was 13, when I bought a copy of Easy <span class="caps">AMOS</span> for my Amiga that I started to program a lot. The key was the excellent book, and the really crappy <span class="caps">IDE</span>. Insert disk, it started, then I started to code, and I could quickly see where I had typed things wrong. Yes, it sucked, but I didn&#8217;t know that then.</p>

<p>I have no idea about the other two points. My brother who has had access to a computer as much I have, was never interested in creating programs, doom levels, music, etc. it was just games. I always thought he was 2 years behind me, and would eventually grasp the things just like me, but he never did and still today mainly uses his computer for games.</p>
