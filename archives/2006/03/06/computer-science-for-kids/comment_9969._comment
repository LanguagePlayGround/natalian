<p>I&#8217;m <a href="http://hexmode.com/453546.html" rel="nofollow">wondering the same thing</a> about my kids (<a href="http://hexmode.com/454060.html" rel="nofollow">more</a>).  This seems to be a popular topic for discussion among even childless programmers and I&#8217;d point you to <a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2005/02/26/6181.aspx" rel="nofollow">Don Box’s thoughts</a> as well.</p>

<p>For myself, I&#8217;m hoping to use Lego Mindstorms and <a href="http://www.yuasa.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~yuasa/xs/" rel="nofollow">XS</a> to teach my kids.  Starting with the concepts in <a href="http://drscheme.org/" rel="nofollow">DrScheme</a> and working up till they can program the ‘bots for battle.</p>

<p>That, I think, is the main point: make it like a game for the kids. Don&#8217;t turn it into a chore.</p>

<p>Also, don&#8217;t look at programming as career training, but as a way for kids to learn and apply concepts from math, logic, and other areas of their education.</p>
