<p>This <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4832224.stm">M$ Vista delay analysis</a> got me thinking about the relationship between hardware manufacturers and well, us, the &#8220;Free software&#8221; geeks.</p>

<p>Vista will no doubt drive hardware sales due to its <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/windowsvista/evaluate/hardware/vistarpc.mspx">high hardware requirements.</a> Hardware manufacturers just love that.</p>

<p>But does <a href="https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/dapper/+bug/1">Ubuntu</a> or Debian drive hardware sales? Erm, probably <strong>not</strong>.</p>

<p>&#8220;competing hardware manufacturers are violating each others <strong>patents</strong> so much that they cannot publish specifications of their hardware without showing which patents they are violating.&#8221; -Aki</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure M$ has no qualms about signing NDAs with hardware companies. But for us, the future isn&#8217;t easy.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think consumer hardware companies are going to shoot for <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/partners/certification/hardware">Ubuntu&#8217;s certification scheme.</a> And Ubuntu is the <strong>consumer</strong> version of <span class="caps">GNU</span> Debian/Linux right now.</p>
