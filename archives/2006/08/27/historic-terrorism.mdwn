<p>Politicians love to get their picture with Nelson Mandela, gives them credibility. Next <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/politics/story/0,,1859409,00.html">David Cameron denounces the UK government&#8217;s policy at the time</a>, where Thatcher branded the <a href="http://www.anc.org.za/"><span class="caps">ANC</span></a> terrorists.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s brave or stupid. People forget that <span class="caps">ANC</span> had a paramilitary wing back then who were <a href="http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/misc/trc2c.html">blowing up restaurants and killing civilians</a>. One family friend &#8220;Tony Hudson&#8221; died in one such attack, which goes down in <span class="caps">ANC</span>&#8216;s Web pages like so:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/misc/trc2c.html">
18/04/86 Bomb explodes in casino of Wild Coast Holiday Inn; 2 civilians killed, 1 injured Note: the ANC denied responsibility for this attack.
</blockquote>

<p>Did that mean &#8220;Apartheid agents&#8221; killed him? Or the <span class="caps">ANC</span> did, but aren&#8217;t sure? Some other crazy?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_and_Reconciliation_Commission">Truth and Reconciliation Commission</a> was setup at the fall of the Apartheid government to document the terrorist activities on both sides. I have yet to read the <a href="http://www.info.gov.za/otherdocs/2003/trc/rep.pdf">report</a>. I&#8217;ve sort have dismissed it as it is common knowledge that files were destroyed and many important people didn&#8217;t give testimony.</p>

<p>Some people say the <span class="caps">ANC</span> wasn&#8217;t a terrorist organisation, it was a <strong>counter-terrorist</strong> organisation, combating Apartheid&#8217;s terrorism. It&#8217;s all a bit of a slippery slope, making &#8220;terrorist&#8221; rhetoric difficult to consume.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve noticed Wikipedia has an interesting category for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Former_designated_terrorist_organizations">terrorist organisations</a> which have gained legitimacy.</p>
