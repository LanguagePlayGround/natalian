<p>Right now rich kids are considering what to do in their gap year. Many charities offer attractive placements for &#8220;volunteers&#8221; to work in different parts of the globe for a price.</p>

<p>Lets begin by saying <strong>paying to work</strong> anywhere in the world is just fucking stupid.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve choked on my beverage when I heard some kid went on some placement in Australia for 2000 <span class="caps">GBP</span>. His friend said, he ended up paying 6000 <span class="caps">GBP</span> to this company by the time he left!</p>

<p>That is just crazy. It is super easy to work in Australia <strong>and</strong> get paid.</p>

<p>People who know me well or just briefly know that I hate charities. If they&#8217;re not operating tax free scams, they&#8217;re paving the way to hell with their &#8220;good intentions&#8221;. They take thousands of pounds from vulnerable gap year adventurers and throw them into poorly organised projects. I loved the Guardian headline <a href="http://travel.guardian.co.uk/gapyears/story/0,,1852960,00.html">Are these the new colonialists?</a></p>

<p>I doubt any gap year students read this blog, though my advice is this. Get a lonely planet guide for the country/region that most takes your fancy, get your flight tickets and just go there. Happy travels.</p>
