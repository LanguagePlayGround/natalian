<p>The UK has taken in about 450k new workers from Eastern Europe in the last two years. About half of them are from Poland. I can testify to this trend myself by observing staff and seeing Eastern European newspapers after being away from the UK for two years.</p>

<p>Some people have kicked up a fuss calling for restrictions.</p>

<p>I think it is <strong>great</strong>. These people work hard and keep wages down. It is amazing what kind of impact this has had. Lets face it. I&#8217;d rather hire a Pole than a local yob to plaster my ceilings.</p>

<p>Though I do have my concerns. The number of new immigrants is staggering. It&#8217;s amazing how the UK has absorbed them. It will probably grow with the introduction of countries like Bulgaria and Romania.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve heard about unscrupulous employers exploiting Eastern Europeans by paying them below the minimum wage. Local UK nationals of course can&#8217;t compete when this happens. I think the government could do better to ensure this exploitation doesn&#8217;t happen by setting up some helpline or something for reports.</p>
