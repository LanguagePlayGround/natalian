<p>My mother has a new Website advertising her <a href="http://prazefarm.co.uk/curtains/">soft furnishing services</a>.</p>

<p>She offers a personal local service, where Cornish residents lacking some amazing interiors should call her up for a chat. She would also love to hear from interior designers with clients in Cornwall. My Dad helps out by installing and hanging the curtains.</p>

<p>She is incredibly knowledgeable about all things textile. She founded Bilbo Fashions in South Africa in 1973 and headed up the successful firm until 1996. So she knows the rag trade very well. I love going shopping with her as she spots good clothing with good fabric and quickly works out how much it would cost to make, hence determining its value for a potential purchase.</p>
