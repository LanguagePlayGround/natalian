<p>Ok, firstly I refuse to use bloatware such as Gnome or <span class="caps">KDE</span>.</p>

<p>Sam, are you suggesting gnome-terminal is a better terminal? I find it really buggy. Thanks very much for the links!</p>

<p>Chris your suggestion of special keyboard keys for this problem is kinda &#8220;out there&#8221;.</p>

<p>nion, wmiipsel is great, though that seems to be for <span class="caps">PRIMARY</span>, not <span class="caps">CLIPBOARD</span></p>

<p>autocutsel program looks interesting, but I gather it needs to be run constantly in the background. That&#8217;s too phat for me.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve updated my <a href="http://svn.natalian.org/home/.Xresources" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">Xresources</a> and I can now paste with Shift+Middleclick in Uxterm. Major improvement !!!  :)</p>
