<p>Yay! I received a reply from Dan Rogerson MP dated 3rd August 2006.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the reply was very generic and didn&#8217;t address my points.</p>

<p>His view is since there is <strong>international consensus</strong> about the need to &#8220;support&#8221; people in Afghanistan the troops will stay there. I had the feeling his concern was if the troops have adequate resources and had the proper planning!</p>

<p>No, no, no&#8230;</p>
