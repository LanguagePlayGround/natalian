<p>2 years ago I took out travel insurance for my <a href="http://maps.natalian.org/">travels</a>. I think it cost me about 150 <span class="caps">GBP</span> for a year and I found it completely useless.</p>

<p>I was mugged in Saint Petersburg on my last trip there and getting a police statement is a bureaucratic nightmare. In many countries I have travelled the police are the very last people I want to deal with after I was imprisoned by the corrupt Russian police. This process can takes ages and can be costly (bribes). My schedule is usually pretty busy, so in many cases I can&#8217;t wait for a &#8220;investigation&#8221; to complete.</p>

<p>Another instance where I lost some stuff was <strong>the</strong> Tsunami. I actually bothered to get a police statement from a fucking crazy police chief who beat the crap out of some local in front of me. Later my mother called to say my Insurance doesn&#8217;t cover me for natural disasters. Actually I think locals stole my stuff, not so much the Tsunami, but that&#8217;s hard to prove.</p>

<p>So as I am about to embark on another expedition in South America, I investigated travel insurance again and this time I am reading the small print and asking questions.</p>

<p>Since I have a bunch of travelling experience I asked the insurer a few questions about an attractive policy.</p>

<p>Are my possessions insured if I get mugged? I have a laptop and camera equipment worth about 1000 <span class="caps">GBP</span>. If I get mugged <strong>and injured</strong> I will get 100 <span class="caps">GBP</span>. Of course I need a police statement as proof and must report the incident within 12 hours. In some counties police stations are closed more that 12 hours a day. My equipment is actually insured up to only a total of 500 <span class="caps">GBP</span>, with each possession worth a maximum of 250 <span class="caps">GBP</span>.</p>

<p>Of course I need to have the <strong>original receipts</strong> and <strong>recent valuations</strong> of each stolen possession. Insurers also take depreciation into account. For example, if your 1000 <span class="caps">GBP</span> laptop is one year old, in the insurer&#8217;s eyes it is actually worth 500 <span class="caps">GBP</span>. That&#8217;s right 50% depreciation a year. Also you&#8217;re only allowed <strong>one</strong> &#8220;mugging claim&#8221; per trip. Well, I&#8217;ve been mugged more than once in my last trip!</p>

<p>What happens if my laptop and equipment get damaged by luggage handlers? Sorry, fragile items are not insured.</p>

<p>Hijack, 30 <span class="caps">GBP</span> for each 24 hour period my vehicle is under hijack. I don&#8217;t know whether to laugh or cry.</p>

<p>Cancellation is absolutely useless as every airline will make alternative arrangements or at least refund you if there is a cancellation. If there is a delay because of industrial action (most common case), you&#8217;re not covered.</p>

<p>Missed departure. If you vehicle breaks down you have to provide evidence the vehicle is properly serviced and maintained and the recovery was made my a recognized breakdown organisation.</p>

<p>10 <span class="caps">GBP</span> for each 8 hour travel delay. 1.25 <span class="caps">GBP</span> an hour. Is that what my time is worth?</p>

<p>Ok, the most important is probably <strong>medical</strong>. For this to work you <strong>must</strong> call the insurance <strong>before</strong> you get treated. In many countries calling the UK is very difficult. In the times I&#8217;ve been omitted to hospital, the last thing I want to do is to be negotiating my treatment with my insurer.</p>

<p>There are many cases where I am not covered for medical. For example if I injure myself doing &#8220;activity sports&#8221;. There are strange conditions for this. For example I am covered for up to 7 days of horse riding.</p>

<p>Insurance claims in my experience rarely pay out. When they do, they often minimise the damage. For example I had a computer struck by lightning. They sent me a crap computer which they thought matched the specs of the computer!</p>

<p>When insurers don&#8217;t pay out, you probably will not have the resources to take them to court. There also can be very <strong>slow</strong> to pay out. By that time you probably have had to cut your trip short. Most insurers only allow you to claim once you are back <strong>in the UK</strong>.</p>

<p>Is it worth it? I can understand how the insurers want to protect themselves from false claims and people not taking the proper precautions, but I think I&#8217;ve definitely hit some problems.</p>

<p>I am quite fit, but I still worry about crazy hospital bills. I would definitely <strong>not take out any insurance if I knew hospitals would be reasonable</strong>. In many countries like India they are reasonable. In fact in Russia &amp; Australian/NZ there are reciprocal health agreements with the UK. But in some places I&#8217;ve travelled like Korea, expect 600USD charges for seeing a doctor and running a few tests.</p>
