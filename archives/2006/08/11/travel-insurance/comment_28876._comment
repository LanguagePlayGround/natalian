<p>I just heard a hilarious story from <a href="http://www.myspace.com/andy_may" rel="nofollow">Andy May</a> about his travel insurance.</p>

<p>He broke his arm and he had to wait <span class="caps">ONE</span> <span class="caps">WEEK</span> for his Australian Travel Insurance to give the go ahead on treatment in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Admittedly the medical costs here are expensive. 20000 reals, ~10000 <span class="caps">USD</span>. But still! He said he had no feeling in his hand and it could have easily healed incorrectly. Scary.</p>
