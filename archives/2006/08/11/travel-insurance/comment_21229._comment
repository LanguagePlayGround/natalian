<p>MM, I&#8217;ve got terrible experience with Dutch health insurance. At one point I was both obliged to get a health insurance and unacceptable for health insurance for a six-month period. Later this month I will be moving to Iceland, and both my health insurance company and my liability insurance company have no clue what to do with people who are moving abroad. If I cancel my Dutch health insurance but return to Holland at a later point, I will once again be refused health insurance if I have any physical complaints. As a chronical case of <span class="caps">RSI</span>, my only way of getting an insurance in this country is to lie.</p>
