<p>This morning I&#8217;ve been on the phone to <span class="caps">SAMPO</span>, Finland. They seem to think transfers with &#8220;Easy Payment&#8221; are free between EU countries. They gave my <span class="caps">PIC</span> code and told me to call my bank.</p>

<p>I then called Barclays International personal banking and they said the charge is 20 <span class="caps">GBP</span> and that all UK banks charge.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve just called Nationwide.co.uk. They also charge 20 <span class="caps">GBP</span>. <span class="caps">BLAH</span>.</p>

<p>Tried calling Deutsche Bank London. They say they&#8217;re a purely investment bank in the UK, no retail. <span class="caps">FFS</span>. If I opened an account with them in Germany, the <a href="http://www.deutsche-bank.de/pbc/content/ser_eur_en_index.html" rel="nofollow">do claim</a> to offer free EU transfers. Though in that link, France isn&#8217;t in the scheme. <span class="caps">WTF</span></p>
