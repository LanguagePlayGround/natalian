Since living in Europe most of my adult life, I've enjoyed free of cost
emergency medical care.

Since I have a dependent pass in Singapore, I'm looking into the options.
Normally expatriates enjoy free medical care via their workplace, though since
I'm a Entrepreneur. Different story of pain.

<http://www.expatinsurance.com.sg/> seem to be the experts and conveniently
located in 20 Upper Circular Road where <abbr title="Ministry of
Manpower">MOM</abbr> is, the Singapore government department that issue passes.

Travel insurance plans aside, the two options they proposed were:

* AXA Elite for 1342SGD annual premium
* MSIG Platinum for 1080SGD annual premium

I prefer [MSIG](https://www.msig.com.sg/) so far, since it's cheaper, though
the basic outpatient service all have a 100SGD excess (deductible claim) for a
_course of treatment_.  Tbh seeing an **expensive** doctor in Singapore
privately costs no more than 100SGD.

A big annoying down side for both options is that they require **Claims filing
by Post**. A paper nightmare procedure if you want to claim back any money.

I have been quickly look for more options. A [Wikipedia list of Singaporean
insurers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_insurance_companies_in_Singapore)
unfortunately lumps most consumer insurance under "General Insurers". After
looking through several only a fraction offer personal medical insurance.

I learnt about the [International Medical
Centre](http://www.imc-healthcare.com/) via some AXA travel related literature.
Their cashless system like IIRC the South African system MediCare **card**
sounded VERY ATTRACTIVE because it is super convenient. On their
<http://www.imc-healthcare.com/insurance> page they indicate other insurers as:

* [Bupa](http://www.bupa-medical.com/)
* [Allianz](http://www.allianzworldwidecare.com/healthcare-in-singapore)
* [Global Health](https://globalhealthasia.com/)
* [Vanbreda International](https://www.vanbreda-international.com) which is part of [Cigna](http://www.cigna.com.sg/)

I will try make enquiries with them and their awful websites, if they offer online claims.

I'm a bit confused by the utility of <abbr title=International Mediacal
Centre>IMC</abbr> since Singaporean hospitals and polyclinics are upto a
Western standard. <abbr title=International Mediacal Centre>IMC</abbr> seem to
target just expats which sounds worryingly inefficient.
