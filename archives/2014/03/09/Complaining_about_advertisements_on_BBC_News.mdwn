So I complained online a couple of weeks ago about the crashing flash and
advertisements while trying to watch BBC News videos in Singapore.

I didn't seem to get a copy of my original complaint, but I did make a video above.

Making a complaint on BBC news Website is a bit too hard IMHO. Had to go
through a myriad of hoop jumping forms.

I got a reply on March 7th:

<blockquote>

After replying to <bbc_faq_website@bbc.co.uk>, asking for my original
complaint, I got a [Undelivered Mail Returned to
Sender](http://s.natalian.org/2014-03-09/bbc_faq_reply_fail.txt).

Could be a LOT better BBC. :/
