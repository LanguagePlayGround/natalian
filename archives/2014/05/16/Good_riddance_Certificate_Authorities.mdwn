I've long moaned and bitched about Certificate Authorities and the cost of SSL,
and recently I think I've seen the light at the end of the tunnel.

It's called DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities aka <abbr
title="DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities">DANE</abbr> and Domain Name
System Security Extensions aka <abbr title="Domain Name System Security
Extensions">DNSSEC</abbr>.

This will as I understand it, put the multi-million "Certificate Authority"
industry out of business. Goodbye Verisign, Thawte, Geotrust, RapidSSL.

I've archived a list of the [trusted Mozilla
CAs](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/security-group/certs/included/)
currently shipped in Firefox
[here](http://s.natalian.org/2014-05-16/Mozilla-CAS-2014-05.html) for future
prosperity.

Folks in the future might think, it's amazing that we had a system that allowed
the Turkish government to impersonate any SSL secured Website.

In order to make this sea change possible, I urge you to lobby your DNS service
to support
[DNSSEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions)
and get experimenting with
[DANE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities).
