My wife wanted to share some good news, a project she helped design has been launched!

She popped up the browser and searched "70 st patricks"

* [http://www.seventystpatricks.org/](http://s.natalian.org/2014-09-19/whois-seventystpatricks.org.txt) - INCORRECT
* [http://seventystpatricks.com/](http://s.natalian.org/2014-09-19/whois-seventystpatricks.com.txt) - NOPE
* http://www-70stpatricks.com/ - No, not this one
* [http://www.70saintpatrick.com/] - This is a scam
* [http://www.70stpatricksofficial.com/](http://s.natalian.org/2014-09-19/whois-70stpatricksofficial.com.txt) - Nope, not official
* http://70-stpatrick.com/ - no, no, no!

This site: <http://www.70stpatricks.com.sg/> was the official one!

So who is behind this domain squatting? Notice how naughty `www-70stpatricks.com` is!
