My dream hardware project, the project I check <https://www.kickstarter.com/>
periodically for, is a "smart" <abbr title="Miniature Circuit
Breaker">MCB</abbr> that could fit in a typical circuit switch board, but with
two additional features:

1. Wifi <abbr title="Internet of Things">IoT</abbr> connectivity so I can _at least_ TURN OFF that switch
1. An API to read out of how much power the circuit is pulling in kilowatts, like [Wireless electricity meter idea](/archives/2007/02/21/wireless-electricity-meter-idea)

# Use case

Ever left your home with the Iron or Air-conditioner on?

I want a simple Web application to be able to see a total & break down of how
much power my home is using. If I noticed some grave irregularity (like leaving
an iron on!!), I can just switch the power off for that circuit altogether.

Update: Kickstarter projects like the electricity monitor <http://www.neurio.io/> are a step in the right direction.
