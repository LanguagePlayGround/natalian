I've complained about <a
href="http://natalian.org/archives/2013/09/28/Superfast_Cornwall/">Superfast
Cornwall rural broadband rollout technology being a poor choice for rural
locations before</a>.

Now I have a nice graph to illustrate the point:

The image is from <http://nbnmyths.wordpress.com/> which is site devoted to
outing the scandal of the "next generation" Australian broadband roll out.

So unless you live ontop of a cabinet, FTTC (VDSL), the product that Superfast
Cornwall tout can well be an expensive waste of time. The cheaper older ADSL
can be better than FTTC in distances greater than 2km!!

To add to the confusion of my FTTC "superfast" install, we are told our line
length is 3400m, even though I can drive to the cabinet in a mile.

Rural Cornwall connectivity looks bleak. BT Openreach probably won't lay fibre
or allow folks like me to pull fibre through their conduits. My ISP says the
best I can do is buy another line and consider bonding them, doubling again my
ISP costs to ~100GBP per month.

3G might come along. I could perhaps consider long range wifi with a neighbour
who lives closer to the exchange. But those options will have high latency.

What a disaster. :(
