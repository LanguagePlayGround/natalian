99 times out of 100 it will be with BT.

Say you want to redirect your email. Easy peasy. Free of cost.

Say you want to redirect your telephone number to your mobile or VOIP system? Lets assume you are redirecting to a local number, the cheapest possible way to do it.

First you need Call Diversion, 3.50GBP.

Now you must pay for the incoming call which is redirected:

* 11:18	£1.230
* 2:21	£0.420
* 0:39	£0.240
* 0:02	£0.240
* 0:47	£0.240
* 3:15	£0.210
* 0:24	£0.170
* 0:09	£0.170
* 0:05	£0.240
* 0:23	£0.170

This can amount pretty quickly!!

I'm told you can cumbersomely get your number if you disconnect your line,
which is obviously hugely inconvienant.

Pity OFCOM are not doing anything to improve number portability and competition AFAIK.
