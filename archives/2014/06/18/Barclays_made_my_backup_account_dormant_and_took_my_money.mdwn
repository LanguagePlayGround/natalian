Since I travel a lot, I keep a backup current account debit card in a secret
location in case my wallet is stolen or lost.

That un-expired card failed to work earlier this year. I later logged onto
Barclays online banking to find no trace of it.

The account had 693.73GBP in it.

I called up Barclays quoting the account number and sort code printed on the
bottom of the card... at first the "customer service representative" worryingly
could not tell me what has happened. Two phone calls later and a visit to my
branch, reveals that my backup account is considered "dormant" because I have
**not used it for a year**.

Later it turns out I was sent a letter on the 17 December from "Mr D Wass"
warning me that "Your current account has not been used for some time". It
instructed me to call Barclays by the 10th of March 2014. Since I'm **terrible
with post**, I failed to read this single warning letter.  And now my account
is [dormant](http://www.barclays.co.uk/dormantandlostaccounts). This letter was
**not found** upon their Document Management service "Barclays Cloud It", which I think
it should be.

At the branch I'm given a long <https://www.bba.org.uk/> form to fill in. I've
already wasted many hours on this, and now I need to provide personal details to
a 3rd party, in order to get my money back? I'm shocked. Why can't Barclays
simply re-open my account?!

I called up <https://www.bba.org.uk/> to express my frustration. The
receptionist tells me that they simply act as a post box for Barclays dormant
accounts team. I've now just spent half an hour filling a form in
<https://www.mylostaccount.org.uk/>, which could have a better [SSL
support](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=mylostaccount.org.uk).

I am still waiting to get my money back. I also want to lobby Barclays to:

1. Inform me of account changes on the online banking application which I use regularly and not post
* Stop this insane practice. Why the HELL wasn't MY MONEY put into my other current account at the **VERY LEAST**?
