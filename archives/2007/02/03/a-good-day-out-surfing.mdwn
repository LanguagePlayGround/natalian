<p>The thought I have been entertaining lately are opensource Web applications and I have been surfing the Web for examples.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have admired the UK productions from <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/">MySociety</a> and I have joined their mailing list. Great <a href="http://dabase.com/l">another list to get through</a>. :)</p>

<p>Through that list I discovered a good Friday night&#8217;s worth of entertainment.</p>

<a href="http://roslingsblogger.blogspot.com/">Hans Rosling</a>'s <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4237353244338529080&amp;sourceid=searchfeed">talk about the myths about the developing world</a> with <a href="http://tools.google.com/gapminder/">amazing flash graphics</a>.

<p>Via that I discovered <a href="http://www.ted.com/tedtalks/"><span class="caps">TED</span> talks</a>. There is some stimulating stuff here. Enjoy.</p>
