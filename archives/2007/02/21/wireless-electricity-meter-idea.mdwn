<p>I&#8217;ve noticed in the UK a lot of broadband providers are pushing Wireless access points, notably <a href="http://www.wireless.bt.com/">BT</a>.</p>

<p>So this provides fertile soil of innovative products around the house. For example I am keen to get better &#8220;visibility&#8221; of how I consume electricity here on <a href="http://prazefarm.co.uk/">Praze Farm</a>. It is fairly straightforward to plot the data in a nice <span class="caps">SVG</span> graph, though getting that data is the hard part.</p>

<p>Introducing the Wireless electricity meter. A device which joins your wireless network, that runs a Web service where one can read the meter via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST"><span class="caps">REST</span></a>.</p>

<p>So I could plot this data in an internal Web application (could also be on the Wireless meter device) so I can see how I use my electricity and understand how I can save electricity too.</p>

<p>Perhaps if the Wireless broadband access point was smart, it could securely route requests from our Electricity company to read the meter remotely. This could save a lot of money.</p>
