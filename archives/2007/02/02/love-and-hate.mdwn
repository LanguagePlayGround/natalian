<blockquote>Criticism may not be agreeable, but it is necessary. It fulfils the same function as pain in the human body. It calls attention to an unhealthy state of things.

<p>&#8212;Winston Churchill</blockquote></p>

<p>Friends think I can be a bit &#8216;over critical&#8217; of certain things shall we say. So I propose: When I complain about something, I will praise something else.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>I hate how Websites can&#8217;t seem to tell you the delivery cost of an item until you signup and go through umpteen checkout steps. (complaint)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>I love how quiet my Thinkpad X40 is. (praise)</li>
</ul>

<p>As usual Wikipedia have an interesting read on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critic">critics</a> and there is a funny looking book on Amazon called &#8220;Is it just me or is everything shit?&#8221;.</p>
