<p>Hi!</p>

<p>Yes it can run from <span class="caps">USB</span>. Download the .img and give it a try. <a href="http://download.webconverger.com/">http://download.webconverger.com/</a></p>

<p>Though <span class="caps">USB</span> boot support seems only present in machines built in the last year or two in my experience.</p>

<p>The default Webconverger does include the non-free Flash, so on &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221; Webconverger &#8216;just works&#8217;!</p>

<p>Best wishes,</p>
