<p>When buying insurance, my advice is to go:</p>

<ol>
<li>local</li>
<li>reputable</li>
<li>mutual</li>
</ol>

<p>At least 2 of 3 is required.</p>

<p>There are many &#8220;money insurance comparison sites&#8221; on the Web and most of them <span class="caps">IMHO</span> are cons. Their Web forms are usually very bad, terms unclear and customer service is somewhere between terrible and non-existent.</p>

<p>For example my sister bought insurance off the net. After they took her money, they ask for &#8220;proof&#8221; of a no claims bonus. She couldn&#8217;t provide satisfactory proof as she has been on my parent&#8217;s policy. The insurance quote then doubled and of course it wasn&#8217;t the cheapest quote by far. Then when she wanted to cancel the insurance she has to now pay 20+ cancellation fees and they&#8217;ve already taken at least 30GBP at her account. These &#8220;insurers&#8221; are criminals.</p>

<p>After kicking up a fuss, we did get the money back from this Internet insurance and now we&#8217;re insured with several extras like breakdown, windscreen at a local Cornish insurer.</p>
