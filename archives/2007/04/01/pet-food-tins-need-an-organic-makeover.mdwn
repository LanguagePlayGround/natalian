<p>I&#8217;ve been looking after my family&#8217;s pet whippet and occassionally feeding him. I&#8217;ve come to notice how awful dog food tins are.</p>

<p>In particular <a href="http://www.purina.co.uk/">Winalot from Purina</a> stands out as being scarily bad. I just tried to complain to their Website and the Website asks me first to register. Ummm&#8230; no thanks!</p>

<p>Ok after a whois and learning that they are in fact the evil <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestle">Nestle company</a> I thought I&#8217;ll voice my concerns publicly on my blog.</p>

<p>Their dog food doesn&#8217;t smell a bit like the label claims. I&#8217;ve fell short of actually tasting it, though don&#8217;t you think a Tuna tin should smell &#8220;just a little&#8221; like Tuna? Every flavour alarmingly smells the same.</p>

<p>When reading the label, it seems though you get a minimum of just 4% meat! That&#8217;s pitifully small.</p>

<p>How awful! And with this &#8220;recycling craze&#8221; hitting Cornwall, I&#8217;m also supposed to wash out and clean these disgusting tins.</p>

<p>Update: Skippy finally managed to find some organic Easter rabbit.<br />
