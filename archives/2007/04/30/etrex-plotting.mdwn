<p>This morning I thought I couldn&#8217;t get my <span class="caps">GPS</span> tracklog from my bike ride through London off my Etrex <span class="caps">GPS</span> device as I didn&#8217;t have:</p>

<ol>
<li>A serial port on my X40</li>
<li>Google plus (20USD for getting data off my <span class="caps">GPS</span>!) on my Windows desktop at work</li>
</ol>

<p>As I left work, a colleague suggested I try an <span class="caps">USB</span> serial adaptor that was lying around. He also gave me a CD with the drivers. I said I don&#8217;t need drivers! I run Debian, much to my colleague&#8217;s bemusement.</p>

<p>Anyhoo, the <span class="caps">USB</span>/Serial interface works well, it comes up like so:</p>

<pre>
Apr 30 22:56:53 monty kernel: usbcore: registered new driver usbserial
Apr 30 22:56:53 monty kernel: drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.c: USB Serial support registered for generic
Apr 30 22:56:53 monty kernel: usbcore: registered new driver usbserial_generic
Apr 30 22:56:53 monty kernel: drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.c: USB Serial Driver core
Apr 30 22:56:53 monty kernel: drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.c: USB Serial support registered for pl2303
Apr 30 22:56:53 monty kernel: pl2303 2-1:1.0: pl2303 converter detected
Apr 30 22:56:53 monty kernel: usb 2-1: pl2303 converter now attached to ttyUSB0
</pre>

<p>Then I ran:</p>

<tt>gpsbabel -t -i garmin -f /dev/ttyUSB0 -o gpx -F tracklog.gpx</tt>

<p>To download the track log from the Garmin. Then I converted the <span class="caps">GPX</span> into <span class="caps">KML</span> with this <a href="http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/map?form=googleearth">Gpsvisualizer Web application</a>.</p>

<p>Then I load up the <span class="caps">KML</span> with <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a> to see where and when I have been cycling London. Google Earth really needs the package libgl1-mesa-dri installed to get <span class="caps">DRI</span> working on my X40 machine.</p>

<p>Though I prefer not to use Google Earth. I wish I could load the data with this <a href="http://libgmail.sourceforge.net/googlemaps.html">Google maps animator</a>, though the service doesn&#8217;t seem to accepting new accounts. Grrr&#8230;</p>

<p>Update: Just a couple of comments about riding in London:<br />
* There are more bike paths than I expected<br />
* Traffic was real easy last Sunday<br />
* Overtaking buses is scary, but it&#8217;s better than sitting behind them in the fumes and you do tend to go much faster on average than a bus</p>
