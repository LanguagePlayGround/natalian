<p>I received some Webconverger feedback today, saying this guy tried:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=123098&amp;package_id=146542">Boothcd</a></li>
<li><a href="http://livekiosk.com/">EZwebPC</a></li>
<li><a href="http://thinstation.sourceforge.net">Thinstation</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.kioskcd.com/">KioskCD</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Though he found <a href="http://webconverger.com/">Webconverger</a> &#8220;what he was looking for&#8221;. Relief. :) Though I was initially surprised at how much competition there is in this space! Sadly BoothCD and KioskCD seem very out of date. Thinstation seems to be targeting a different audience altogether and I haven&#8217;t given it a try.</p>

<p>There is also a <a href="http://www.osweekly.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2500&amp;Itemid=449">review of Kiosk distributions that Webconverger unfortunately escaped from</a>. There the winner was <a href="http://www.livekiosk.com/">LiveKiosk</a> aka <a href="http://webconverger.com/about/">EzWebPC, which features in the Webconverger comparison matrix</a>.</p>

<p>I think EzWebPC has come from <a href="http://www.morphix.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=80&amp;Itemid=59">Morphix  LiveKiosk</a>, which came from <a href="http://www.kiberpipa.org/~gandalf/blog/?p=75">Jure</a>&#8216;s work on <a href="http://www.livecd.net/">LiveCD</a>. Anyway I did mail Livekiosk/EzWebPC asking them for the source and they didn&#8217;t reply. Hence I started Webconverger. I knew I could make something better out of <a href="http://debian-live.alioth.debian.org/">Debian Live</a> and 2 months down the road&#8230; Webconverger <strong>is</strong> much better.</p>

<p>A highly requested feature for Webconverger is a hard drive install option and I was shocked to see another new kiosk project called <a href="http://www.rpath.org/rbuilder/project/kiosk/release?id=5177">Kiosk appliance</a> (screen shot above) with such a feature. Oh damn! :) Though I did test &#8220;Kiosk appliance&#8221; out and though it seems to install to a hard drive via a RH thing&#8230; the distribution is <strong>very immature</strong> and it actually didn&#8217;t manage to connect to the internet for me. I think it might be because of the Tor stuff. I am not sure. <a href="http://webconverger.com/">Webconverger</a> <strong>will</strong> have a much better hard drive install than that. :)</p>
