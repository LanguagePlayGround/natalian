<p>I have a couple of problems with recycling in Cornwall, UK.</p>

<ol>
<li>I have to spend time <a href="http://natalian.org/archives/2007/04/01/pet-food-tins-need-an-organic-makeover/">washing out tins</a>&amp;bottles and folding paper/cardboard</li>
<li>I have to take them out on a special day(s) for collection</li>
<li>I have pay an extra 25% on my existing refuse bill for them to collect the carefully prepared recycled waste and sell it</li>
</ol>
