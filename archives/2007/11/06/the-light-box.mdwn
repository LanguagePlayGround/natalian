<a href="http://www.thelightbox.org.uk/">The light box</a> is gives a good first impression from the outside. Though I after visiting it inside last Sunday I was left unimpressed. It lacks vision.

<ul>
<li>I believe this building cost <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woking">Woking</a> ratepayers 7.5 million <span class="caps">GBP</span>.</li>
<li>It seems manned by &#8220;volunteers&#8221;. Why not pay people to do a good job?</li>
<li>A photography exhibition. Why build a 7 million pound building to house some photographs?! <span class="caps">PUT</span> <span class="caps">THEM</span> ON <span class="caps">FLICKR</span>.</li>
<li>Enter new technology. Enter the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/1858078547/in/set-72157602964949122/">looping <span class="caps">DVD</span> display</a>. How boring!</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.thelightbox.org.uk/content.php?page_id=1481">Woking history</a> section also struck me as a little gimicky with that &#8220;behind the door&#8221; interaction crap.</li>
<li>The exhibition you have to pay-for was <a href="http://www.thelightbox.org.uk/content.php?page_id=1491">Wallace and Gromit</a>. Complete with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/1858073409/in/set-72157602964949122/">expensive interactive displays</a>. How about using a real computer and proper software? Learn how produce animations with <strong>real tools</strong>. It probably costs the same if you use Free software.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/1858903800/in/set-72157602964949122/">Where are the computers?</a> in your &#8220;workshops&#8221;. This is the 21st century!</li>
<li>I asked about Wireless Internet in the building. No one seemed to know. I did find a locked &#8220;lightbox&#8221; Wireless Access Point.</li>
<li>I wish there were more <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/1858894094/in/set-72157602964949122/">views of the canal</a>. Why was the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/1858068957/in/set-72157602964949122/">patio locked</a>?</li>
<li>There are a couple of rooms, the &#8220;ambassador room&#8221; and the &#8220;research room&#8221;, that can be rented out. I asked how much these rooms cost to rent and no one seemed to know. It&#8217;s gets worse&#8230;</li>
<li>I couldn&#8217;t see the &#8220;ambassador room&#8221; as there was a puppet workshop happening. I also couldn&#8217;t see the &#8220;research room&#8221; as the volunteer who can open that only comes in on <strong>Thursdays</strong>. So this room is only available Thursdays? <span class="caps">WTF</span>?</li>
</ul>

<p>Ok, quit moaning. Want do I want to see? I was expecting to see an art space like <a href="http://www.kaapelitehdas.fi/">The Cable Factory</a>. A place where artists can have some cheap <strong>space</strong> and where the public can freely browse their creativity.</p>

<p>I was also expecting a theatre chamber. A place to comfortably debate or give little informal productions. A community space for <strong>people to interact with each other</strong>, meet, to discuss and learn. Perhaps the rooms I didn&#8217;t see that provide that&#8230;</p>

<p>Perhaps a games room, for board games and chess. Or better still, for <span class="caps">LAN</span> tournaments. <a href="http://www.buncs.com/"><span class="caps">BUNCS</span></a> style! :) You can learn a lot by playing computer games.</p>

<p>I also would love to see some sort of &#8220;hack lab&#8221;. Where people can just come in with their laptops and work on something. The Light Box doesn&#8217;t have to supply computer or laptops, though it would be nice. People could give little late night workshops on Web design or how to make a video for Youtube. :)</p>

<p>Just a few comfortable seats, easy access to some (Korean Nong-Shim) pot noodles and <strong>fast internet</strong>. For example, a venue for <a href="http://www.surrey.lug.org.uk"><span class="caps">LUG</span> meetings</a>.</p>

<p>Invest in the knowledge economy. We just need a <strong>place</strong> with security and <em>fast</em> Internet.</p>
