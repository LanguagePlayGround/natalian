<p>Well the criminal gangs seem to have deleted my comment.</p>

<p>I think I said that</p>

<p>a) This is not security through obscurity, most security systems have some sort of secret key, <span class="caps">PGP</span> for example, you would not describe as security through obscurity, and besides, the passport number does not seem to mean anything.</p>

<p>b) What is the problem here? It&#8217;s not that passports are insecure, it&#8217;s that people trust/use passports in ways that they shouldn&#8217;t. If the scammer is using your passport to persuade the scammee that he is you then the scammee should not be taken in by it, and anyway, so what if he is you? If Western Union accepts copies of passports as ID then they should not be doing that. Western Union&#8217;s site state that they do accept passports, but not whether they accept photocopies, I suppose a lax shop might do even if they state they do not on their website.</p>

<p>I guess we really do need ID cards! ;)</p>
