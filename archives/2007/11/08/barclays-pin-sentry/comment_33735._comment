<p>Totally amazed.</p>

<p>Why on earth are Barclays doing this?  What an almighty preamble.  No longer can I just log-on to internet banking.  Oh no, now I have to go get my wallet, get the card, put the card in the stupid plastic thing, write the last 5 digits of my card in the browser space, enter my <span class="caps">PIN</span> on the stupid plastic machine, then type in an 8 digit code the stupid machine gives me.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s just to log on and check my balance.</p>

<p>What a joke Barclays.</p>

<p>If I want to go and set up a payment to someone I have to repeat the above with a couple more steps.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s security and there&#8217;s p*ssing your customers off so badly they move accounts&#8230;.</p>

<p>Which is exactly what I&#8217;m going to do.  I have a business account too so I have to do this stupid plastic machine dance for each account.</p>

<p>Hope you go bust Barclays.  The stupid tw*t that came up with this hairbraned scheme needs to be put out to grass.</p>

<p>Kudos for the blog post.  I hope more diusgruntled Barclays customers post here and let them know what a farce this is.</p>
