<p>I just cant believe the stupidity and irritation  of the <span class="caps">PIN</span> sentry device causes to the all the customers online banking experience.  &#8220;Truly inconvenience banking&#8221; that is Barclay style.<br />
I have been bombarded with 3 of these devices in my house as somehow our another I have ammased 9 accounts with Barclays by accident over time.  If you want to use your banking in different places all you need to do is carry this flat slim and easy to fit in you wallet device with you &#8211; Brilliant, genius.. Give the twit an award who cracked this one out!!</p>
