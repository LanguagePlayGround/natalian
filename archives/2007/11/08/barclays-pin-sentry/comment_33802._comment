<p>Oh I am so glad others are feeling this. I thought I was alone. ....</p>

<p>Why Why Why? I know it is sad but use my internet banking everyday, sometimes twice to make payments, keep track of current account and any rents coming in. For the past couple of weeks I have used it prehaps twice. I am calling customer services tomorrow to see if they will reverse it for me. If not I will change bank in an instant.</p>

<p>My dad has a business account &amp; is part of Barclays Wealth and he does not need one? Why have some got it and not the others?</p>

<p>Ridiculous</p>
