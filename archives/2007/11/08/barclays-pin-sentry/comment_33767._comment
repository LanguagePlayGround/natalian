<p>You can still make online payments as long as its not to anybody new. So then I tried using the telephone passcode system and they told me that I could not pay anybody new that way either and that I should do that in the branch!!!!!! Totally useless.</p>

<p>Running this system out during Xmas with the usual postal issues and people travelling is totally stupid! They are lucky that the Northern Rock fiasco has been taking the headlines.</p>

<p>Furthermore, currently Barclays want you to notify them everytime you go abroad. They will let you withdraw money once, but then block your card until you call them. I travel lots and they have blocked my card about 12 times during 2007.</p>

<p>I would like to further compound this statement by saying I am actually a Barclays Premier client. Its as crap for everybody.</p>

<p>They will only realise how fed up the clients are when the share price starts to drop. With people looking elsewhere (I am closing my accounts too) this should prove inevitable</p>
