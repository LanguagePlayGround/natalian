To the person that suggested we just use the \"Not got card reader\" link - this requires you to have a Debit card. If your Barclays account does not have a Debit card associated with it (as mine doesn't) it is still impossible to log in without the PINsentry device and the Authentication Card they send you to use with it. The Authentication Card CANNOT be used without the PINsentry reader, so you have no way of even looking at your account.
