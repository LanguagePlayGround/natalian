<p>I have one of the latest Barclays Connet Visa Debit cards begining with numbers 4659, which was issued in October 2007 and it still refuses to let me in to Online banking with the <span class="caps">PIN</span> Sentry device.</p>

<p>I wish that Barclays would for a short time, go back to the old login system until they have sorted out their massive Technical Problems!!</p>
