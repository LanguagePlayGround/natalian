<p>I&#8217;m with you on this one.</p>

<p>I think barclays will lose thousands of customers, I am certainly concidering moving. How can they expect us to take this device everywhere and to suggest that we use telephone banking when on the move.</p>

<p>I also had a replacement card sent to me, even though I recieved a replacement card 4 weeks ago.</p>

<p>So many other companies are concerned about their &#8220;carbon foot-print&#8221; yet barclays have wasted resources on: <br />
1) the envelope (x2)<br />
2) the paper used to send the letters (x2)<br />
3) the plasic card (x1)<br />
4) the card reader (x1)<br />
5) the fuel used to deliver both the card reader, my pin number and the replacement card. (x3)</p>

<p>And all of this multiplied by 500,000 (the number of customers with online banking).</p>
