<p>This has been a nightmare for me &#8211; I have been living in Czech, and during the roll out of this fiasco I have moved to the czech republic. It has been an unmitigated disaster &#8211; In 20 years of having several personal and business accounts with Barclays, I have never known something as inconvenient as this. To have to use a cheap tacky block <span class="caps">AND</span> my card every time I want to do something with on-line banking is a serious inconvenience.</p>

<p>To top this off I have had My card stopped 2 times in the past month which is so annoying and really quite dangerous. However &#8211; when phoning them to rfesolve it via Skype (to uk and then forwarded ironically back to india) I have complained very strongly about how terrible it is and have said that if it is not reversed by middle of February I will move all accounts to another bank.</p>

<p>I would urge all other users to do the same. As Dasani was to coke, Pin sentry is to Barclays.</p>

<p>B,</p>
