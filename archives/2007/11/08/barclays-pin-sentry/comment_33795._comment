<p>Oh my goodness this is the best possible method of reducing your client numbers I have ever seen!  Good on you Barclays.</p>

<p>I live in Central Africa and no plans to go back to UK in the near future, have had NO warning of this ridiculous new policy I now cannot make payments having to ask a third party to do so on my behalf.  Furthermore I have no idea how I would ever get a secure postage of card and reader let alone the following pin numbers here in time for Christmas.  I wonder if Barclays will pay the <span class="caps">DHL</span> fees as well as any costs incurred whilst I go on holiday?!  I doubt it.</p>

<p>Finally, I am now going to have to have a very harsh conversation with Barlcays over a bad international Skype line paid by ME to you asking <span class="caps">WTF</span> I am supposed to do&#8230;</p>

<p>So farewell Barclays at my earliest convenience I will be transfering all my cash elsewhere, I hope others will do too.</p>
