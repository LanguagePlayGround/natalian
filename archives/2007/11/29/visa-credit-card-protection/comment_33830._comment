<p>I have now been sent a PINsentry. You&#8217;re right, it&#8217;s annoying to have to even think about carrying it everywhere that I might want to login. But the thing is, every time I login they ask me if I&#8217;ve received one and every time I say no. It&#8217;s been working for about a month now, I wonder how long it will continue to work :)</p>
