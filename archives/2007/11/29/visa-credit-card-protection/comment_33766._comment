<p>1. I want convenience. I don&#8217;t want to have to transfer money into a savings account for a pitiful rate of interest or as my bank advises, to limit how much money fraudsters can withdraw!</p>

<p>2. If you do this payment automatically how do you check people have not made fraudulent purchases using your credit card number? I think this &#8220;useful&#8221; feature defeats the point.</p>

<p>3. If <em>banking codes</em> &#8220;protect&#8221; you, how come banks are always trying to up sell credit card insurances?</p>

<p>When I&#8217;ve bought home insurance, I don&#8217;t see my house being protected from flooding. I see the house being insured for possible flood damage. Makes a whole lot more sense to me that way.</p>
