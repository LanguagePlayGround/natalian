<p>Are you ok? I really don&#8217;t get it.</p>

<p>1. Savings accounts are high interest. <br />
2. You don&#8217;t get charged interest if you pay the balance off in the first month, which you can set up to happen automatically. Pretty useful for expense accounts.<br />
3. The banking codes means that banks should give you your money back when you get defrauded online or off, it&#8217;s always worked for me (3 times).</p>
