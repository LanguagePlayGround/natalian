<p>Orkut may be still big in Brazil or India, but I don&#8217;t care about it. This is about ME Jamie. ;)</p>

<p>These services as you point out are actually about <strong>keeping contact with your existing friends</strong>. I was wrongly assuming you actually supposed to meet new people. :)</p>

<p>So &#8216;networking&#8217; is more of a state than a verb.</p>

<p>When it comes to keeping tabs on my friends I use <span class="caps">IRC</span>/Gmail(Jabber) chat, <strong>email</strong>, skype / voice calls, (a mailing list) and I guess Flickr&#8217;s <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/friends/">http://flickr.com/photos/friends/</a> page. Sometimes even this blog.</p>
