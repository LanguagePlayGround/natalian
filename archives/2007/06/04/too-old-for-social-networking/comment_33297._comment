<p>I think a lot of people would say they prefer IM, if you prefer email then why do we automatically chat on gmail if we&#8217;re both online? And why do we skype for that matter, if it&#8217;s such an awful non-standard experience? But it&#8217;s a dumb question, apples and oranges mate. The user does not care about standards, you should know this by now, does Jutta care about standards? Do I? Do users prefer Linux or Windows?</p>
