<p>How many times have we seen something like:</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/1028035206/" title="Digital signage crash"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1259/1028035206_d6188967cd.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Digital signage done wrong" /></a>

<p>Far too many times! I believe Windows isn&#8217;t stable enough for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signage">Digital Signage</a>.</p>

<p>Enter the <a href="http://webconverger.org/kiosk/">Webcfullscreen mode</a> option:</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/1005612714/" title="Webconverger providing Digital Signage slideshow"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1189/1005612714_9cc94953d4.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Webconverger Fullscreen" /></a>

<p>Ok, this photo slideshow example is done with <a href="http://webconverger.org/adobe/">Adobe Flash</a>, however I think Flash is a suitable option and it can perhaps behave better if the connection goes down temporarily (the offline problem). Could try complex betaware like <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gears/">Google gears</a>&#8230;</p>

<p>Or customers might want a proxy <a href="http://webconverger.org/features/">feature</a> (<a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/">squid</a>), which can be <a href="http://webconverger.com/buy/">customised</a>, so that if the Internet drops, the Digital sign could still work.</p>

<p>Another avenue is to host user&#8217;s Web pages on a local Web server. I am not keen on this as <a href="http://webconverger.org/design/">local data would be against Webc&#8217;s design</a>.</p>

<p>If any of you have your own Digital Signage &#8216;solutions&#8217; you would like to share, please do. <a href="http://webconverger.org/develop">Webconverger is a Free software project based on Debian.</a></p>
