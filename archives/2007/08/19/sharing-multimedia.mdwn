<p>Ok, I have the <a href="http://natalian.org/archives/2007/07/03/slug/">slug</a>. It&#8217;s great because it allows me to easily &amp; reliably share my multimedia collection.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ve moved my multimedia collection to a massive hard drive attached to the slug and now that hard drive is full. I could buy an even bigger <span class="caps">NAS</span>, though wait a minute&#8230;</p>

<p>I have GIGs of (wasted) free space across my (flat mate&#8217;s) machines.</p>

<p>Wtf happened to P2P? I need something like what Google has. <br />
* A distributed file system.<br />
* With search. <br />
* It doesn&#8217;t have to work across on the Internet, though listening to some remote friend&#8217;s music would be nice.<br />
* Any level of data redundancy would be awesome. (I despise <span class="caps">RAID</span>)<br />
* I want direct access from the FS. No odd interfaces. (something with fuse?)</p>

<p>I distantly recall mounting <span class="caps">NFS</span> shares of each of my (friend&#8217;s) machines and then mounting them on the central slug and trying to re-share them. I don&#8217;t think that works.</p>

<p>I remember in University dorms (I&#8217;m not telling where!), students had a massive multimedia share with Windows file sharing. It actually worked quite well, including search.</p>

<p>Any tips lazyweb? Or are centralised services really the future?</p>
