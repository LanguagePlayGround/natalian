<p>Ok, just to be clear I am looking for a <span class="caps">LAN</span> solution.</p>

<p>Also I am not keen on encryption, as I don&#8217;t think its explicitly necessary.</p>

<p>I guess I could just run a samba server. I wonder how it&#8217;s performance compares to <span class="caps">NFS</span>. I wonder if Apple <span class="caps">OSX</span> and Debian/Ubuntu can search a Samba/Windows workgroup for a particular piece of multimedia.</p>

<p>There is defn. a gap in the market here.</p>
