<p>I though and search about this, too. Nothing good out there. It&#8217;s a hard problem.</p>

<p>The problem is redundancy, since you want to handle the (dis)appearance of machines. The best i found was the Glacier system they use at ePost [1]. It can do &#8220;99.9999% data survival even under a 60% correlated failure&#8221;, which means it should be able to provide all files, if you shut down one of your three machines.</p>
