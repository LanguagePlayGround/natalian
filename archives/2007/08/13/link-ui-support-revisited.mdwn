<p>Some time ago I moaned that Firefox does not have a <a href="http://natalian.org/archives/2004/07/19/wtf-is-site-navigation-toolbar/">navigation toolbar</a> that its predecessor Mozilla once did. Link support seems to be implemented within an <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2933">extension</a>/plugin/addon, whatever. Still that&#8217;s not going to aid adoption for &#8220;link&#8221; aided navigation.</p>

<p><span class="caps">AFAIK</span> IE doesn&#8217;t implement <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-link">link</a> navigation at all and Opera does have some <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/hendry/1102589075/">some support hidden away in the menu.</a> Reason why I say <em>some</em>, is because link rel=&#8216;archives&#8217; is currently heavily used on this blog and unfortunately that particular relationship is not supported in Opera. I don&#8217;t think <strong>link rel</strong> is supported on Webkit or any mobile UA I&#8217;ve played with. So I think I&#8217;ll probably do away with the link elements on my blog to save some precious bytes.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve liked the &#8220;link toolbar&#8221;, however it doesn&#8217;t seem to have taken off. I thought it could be an aid for accessibility, but I don&#8217;t think the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/"><span class="caps">WAI</span></a> people have jumped on this. I wonder if Google (or other search engines) uses <strong>link rel</strong> to help crawl the site. Otherwise, I guess <strong>link rel</strong> as a navigation aid will be just one of those things&#8230; like <a href="http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/html-wg/20070417">accesskeys</a>. Actually I like the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/339">Search Keys</a> extension as links are automatically numbered. <a href="http://natalian.org/archives/2004/04/26/line-mode-browser/">I&#8217;ve wanted something like that for my mobile UA for years.</a></p>

<p>Web authors should <strong>write less</strong> and UAs do more, so we probably can do away with link navigation and accesskeys to an extent.</p>
