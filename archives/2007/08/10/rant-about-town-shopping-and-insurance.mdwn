<p>So I am in <a href="http://prazefarm.co.uk">Cornwall</a> and I want to go out and get a fresh Granary bread loaf.</p>

<p>Parents in a huff spending half an hour with our car insurance.<br />
# Finding the right insurance documents<br />
# Working out the right number<br />
# Waiting on hold<br />
# Finding my Dad so he can answer the &#8220;security questions&#8221;<br />
# Asking nicely if their son can be put temporarily on the policy<br />
# Optional: Threatening to leave the insurers for ridiculous quote for one week&#8217;s insurance of an additional 29 year old driver.<br />
# Get the go ahead from the insurers</p>

<p>After watching <a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0386032/">Sicko</a>, my private <a href="http://natalian.org/archives/category/insurance/">insurance hate</a> has been re-energised.</p>

<p>Now I can go down to the local town&#8217;s shops. Actually no, one can&#8217;t get parking in the local town conveniently. I have to drive to a nearby industrial estate where the bakery has a branch. Lovely.</p>

<p>Update: The baker tells me wheat prices are up 100GBP on a ton. That means about a 5 pence rise on all baked products. Granary loaf was 135p, now 140p.</p>
