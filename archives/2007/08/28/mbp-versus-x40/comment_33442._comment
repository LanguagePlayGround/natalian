<p>Oh I had to manually install X11SDK.pkg from the CD1. I miss apt-get so bad&#8230;.</p>

<p>A friend has give me a tip with the keyboard (for a X40 user). <strong>Hit the keys harder</strong>. It seems to work, though I wonder how my poor fingers will cope. :)</p>

<p>Thanks for the tip Jon. I&#8217;ve just installed vmware-tools. I hope it doesn&#8217;t feck when my Ubuntu boots via rEFIt.</p>
