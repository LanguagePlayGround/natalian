<p>While purchasing a couple of <span class="caps">USB</span> sticks from <a href="http://ebuyer.com/">ebuyer.com</a>(E), via <a href="https://checkout.google.com">Google Checkout</a>(GC) I was surprised how many emails they sent me.</p>

<ol>
<li>GC &#8211; order receipt</li>
<li>E &#8211; order confirmation</li>
<li>GC &#8211; you&#8217;ve received a note from E</li>
<li>E &#8211; Payment processed</li>
<li>E &#8211; Order dispatched</li>
<li>GC &#8211; Your order has dispatched (sent twice?!)</li>
</ol>

<p>I guess it is a minor improvement they&#8217;re not sending any <span class="caps">PDF</span>/Word attachments of invoices. This is still all too common. :( <br />
I now notice on my <a href="https://ibank.barclays.co.uk">Internet Banking application on Barclays</a> I get these cryptic reference codes when money goes out like:</p>

<p><b><span class="caps">REF</span> 195 6847321804 <span class="caps">BCC</span></b></p>

<p>Anyone know how I can make that useful?</p>
