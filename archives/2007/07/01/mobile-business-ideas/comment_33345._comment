<p>I think that all your ideas are very good. I know that many girls and guys too would call you for bicycle help. I don&#8217;t know about British tea shops, but the ones here in the <span class="caps">USA</span> are horrible. The costs are outrageous and the tea not very good.  After living in Korea, the cell phones seem so out-of-date here. Kai to the rescue!</p>
