<p>I don&#8217;t know much about Image internals, so it is good of you to try explain them.</p>

<p>I wonder if this scaling inefficiency is the same as the use case of zooming into an image?</p>

<p>I am perhaps wrongly convinced that there must be a way of efficiently viewing bitmap images via network â€œbyte-range requests&#8221;.</p>
