<p>@Henri: I need a layman&#8217;s explanation. Patents aside, I want to be able to have <a href="http://natalian.org/archives/2005/01/21/images/" rel="nofollow">scalable images</a>. There must be a smart way of downloading a portion of an image you&#8217;re interested in. (Like I assume Apple does with its video technology)</p>

<p>@James: Just because it might be a W3C recommendation, doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s any good. That&#8217;s why the <span class="caps">WHATWG</span> began. And yes, I don&#8217;t have time to get worked up about this poor &#8220;user context&#8221; argument of yours. Nice try. :)</p>
