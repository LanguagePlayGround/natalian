<p>The mobile device is a form of Web functionality.</p>

<p>Sure, I&#8217;d love to give a talk about the Web and mobile devices. I&#8217;ll let you know when I can make it up there. :)</p>

<p>Else, you could come to my talk about my business <a href="http://webconverger.com/" rel="nofollow">Webconverger</a> at <a href="http://www.openbusiness.cc/minibar" rel="nofollow">Minibar</a> later this month. I would like to port Webconverger to mobile / embedded devices, though I lack the resources right now.</p>
