<p>Joose points out I don&#8217;t know much about video containers either. ;)</p>

<p>According to Joose &#8216;h264/aac&#8217; is a standard and well implemented across different platforms.</p>

<p>As for size (bad), since Henri and Joose seems to think its the best way to do it, so I guess I can&#8217;t moan too much. Its just that resolutions will inevitably improve and change, so having all these videos targeting a certain resolution doesn&#8217;t leave us with a migration path. Another computing legacy I guess.</p>
