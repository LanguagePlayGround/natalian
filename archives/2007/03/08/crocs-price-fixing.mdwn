<p>I buy my shoes from J shoes in Wadebridge, Cornwall. Excellent store. Last December I picked up a pair of blue crocs for 20GBP, which I&#8217;ve raved about. A couple of days ago my sister went to get a pair too.</p>

<p>They now cost 30GBP at J shoes and I asked why are they more expensive. They said mine were on sale and besides they have received complaints from another store that J shoes were selling Crocs too cheap. Then they casually commented that <a href="http://www.crocs.com/">Crocs</a> HQ has now forced J shoes to sell at 30 <span class="caps">GBP</span>.</p>

<p>Ummm, isn&#8217;t that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_fixing"><strong>illegal</strong> to fix prices</a>?</p>

<p>Staff immediately fell silent. I am really disappointed people let this happen. Show some <strong>backbone</strong> people.</p>

<p>8/6/2008 update: More than a year later I need my Cayman Crocs to be replaced. Still the shoe sales seem fixed on 30GBP. Even on sites like <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/crocs-Crocs-Cayman/dp/B000UUGF7W/">Amazon UK</a>!</p>

<p>I have heard J shoes have been &#8220;getting around&#8221; the Crocs price fixing demand by offering a 5GBP gift voucher with purchases of Crocs at <span class="caps">RRP</span>. Very sad!</p>

<p>17/16/2008: I have taken up a complaint with the <a href="http://www.oft.gov.uk/">Office of fair trading</a>. However the office have put the <strong>onus on me</strong> to provide evidence that Crocs are violating the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_Act_1998">Competition Act</a>, i.e. proof that Crocs are:<br />
* Anti-competitive<br />
* Abusive</p>

<p>After talking with an employee of the Enquiries and Preliminary Investigations Centre at the Office of Fair Trading, she recommended I &#8220;shop around&#8221; for another type of shoe.</p>

<p>I have a loss of confidence in the services the UK government supply. <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/857512.html">Israel</a> for example is taking action. Ultimately J shoes should be feeding the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Fair_Trading"><span class="caps">OFT</span></a> information they need to prosecute <a href="http://finance.google.com/finance?q=crox">Crocs</a>.</p>
