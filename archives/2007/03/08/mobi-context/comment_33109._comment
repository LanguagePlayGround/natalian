<p>&#8220;When I go to any page with any device I want to presented with what I am<br />
looking for straight away, right? Unfortunately nothing works that way!&#8221;</p>

<p>If websites were designed well, the most commonly-required information would be available immediately, on the front page. Other information would be easily available and obvious. If my luxury car broke down (assuming I wasn&#8217;t a poor student, that is&#8230;) I&#8217;d be rather pissed off if I couldn&#8217;t easily find the nearest service station just because I&#8217;d gone to luxurycar.co.uk instead of luxurycar.mobi, and if I was used to going to luxurycar.co.uk then I&#8217;d again be pissed off if I tried to access it on a phone and couldn&#8217;t because of poor design.</p>
