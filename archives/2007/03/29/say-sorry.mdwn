<p>After reading about the 15 detainees in the past few days and now watching <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/2007/03/thursday_29_march_2007.html">Paxman&#8217;s interview on Newsnight</a> I feel like I must say &#8220;sorry&#8221;.</p>

<p>Because no one else seems to be doing it.</p>

<p>When I was in Pakistan I heard from a tribal leader why the British were popular. He said it was because if you stood on an Englishman&#8217;s foot he would say &#8220;sorry&#8221; first. This boat border incident was probably not Britain&#8217;s fault, though I still think we should be the first to say sorry.</p>

<p>It was a really brash move for Britain to go to the UN security council today and I think British diplomacy has lost its way sadly.</p>
