<p>battery techn ology goes forward in very fast pase.. So, it&#8217;s not a suprise that batteries change. Nokia keeps same batteries in mobiles which are from same era, but updates them from once a while. What I like with nokia is that power adapter is the same with every device (except new mobiles has the small form factor). I just had to change my Jabber bluetooth handsfree to Nokia&#8217;s handsfree because of the power adaptor. It&#8217;s way easier to keep just one power adaptor in car for mobile and hf than two.</p>
