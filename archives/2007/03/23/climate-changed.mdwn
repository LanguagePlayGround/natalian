<p>I am not impressed about <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/hendry/431809586/">this advertisement</a> in the <a href="http://www.private-eye.co.uk/">Private Eye</a> by the charity <a href="http://www.christianaid.org.uk">Christian Aid</a>. Age old tactic of making you and I feel guilty, so you&#8217;ll <strong>donate</strong> to their now <strong>environmental</strong> cause.</p>

<p>How about <a href="http://www.hermann-uwe.de/blog/measuring-the-energy-consumption-of-everything-you-own">getting the facts</a> Christian Aid? Computers take about the same power as a light bulb yet provide essential services for this information age. I feel sorry for poor kids out there with parents who will probably berate their child&#8217;s computer usage.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also amused about the similarities whilst browsing the Christian Aid website and the <a href="http://guardian.co.uk/">Guardian</a>. I guess they copied the Guardian&#8217;s site design.</p>

<p>How opportunistic of Christian Aid.</p>
