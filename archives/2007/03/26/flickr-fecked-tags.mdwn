<p>I really don&#8217;t like the way <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> is going.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve really only wanted some sort of <strong>md5sum</strong> for my images. I&#8217;ve asked them to implement this and gave a good suggestion how to do this years ago. With tags, for example <strong>md5:db0afcce66c98e6bcbf1168e8eae629e</strong>.</p>

<p>Instead we have stupid things like collections. Collections are sets of sets. &#8220;Sets&#8221; in themselves are daft, because they can be implemented as <strong>tags</strong>. Yes, collections, sets, md5sum and any other image properties could have all done been implemented as tags. <em>sigh</em></p>

<p>What a mess.</p>
