<p>Fantastic find for foodies!</p>

<p><span class="caps">BBC</span> have videos in a playable Youtube-y format. So I can actually watch them, unlike their usual real player crap (is this the end of Realplayer? please let it be so&#8230;).</p>

<p>Check out their <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/get_cooking/main/index.shtml"><span class="caps">BBC</span> food</a> Flash application. I wish it wasn&#8217;t completely Flash, nonetheless&#8230;</p>

<p>This certainly beats my usual <a href="http://astray.com/recipes/">recipe resource</a>. :)</p>
