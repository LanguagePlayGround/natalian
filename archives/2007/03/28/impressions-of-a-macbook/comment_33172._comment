<p>&gt; When I close the lid, it stops doing what it supposed to do. I <span class="caps">HATE</span> <span class="caps">THAT</span>. If you have power, do not suspend whatever.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know about MacBook, but atleast PowerBook used keyboard to cool the computer. So if you close the lid the temperature of the computer rises. And if you close lid, doesn&#8217;t that mean that you are not using computer?=)</p>

<p>&gt; 2 <span class="caps">USB</span> ports? That’s it? I accidentally jab the Firewire port with my <span class="caps">USB</span> devices</p>

<p>So.. what devices you need? external hard drive? that&#8217;s one.. and if you have good external harddrive, you can use firewire to that</p>

<p>&gt; That camera looks tiny</p>

<p>Tiny, yes.. Good quality for what is for &#8211; yes. Can&#8217;t really find any webcams that has better quality.</p>

<p>&gt; Slow</p>

<p>How much memory you have? I have 1GB on my macbook and it&#8217;s not slow.</p>

<p>&gt; I can’t figure out how to scroll through photos. I think there is some crap Canon image software (why do camera manufacturers seem compelled to ship terrible software with their hardware?) getting in my way here.</p>

<p>iPhoto</p>

<p>&gt; I am slowly starting to discover the shortcuts and how to manage Windows. Alt+Tab fealt wrong though. Can’t launch dictionary. Maybe it’s not installed?</p>

<p>Exposé (f9, f10 and f11) and widgets (f12).</p>

<p>&gt; Plugging in my external <span class="caps">USB</span> fat32 hard drive didn’t work! With nfs to access my media, I was surprised how to listen an mp3, you have to copy the file into Itunes. Omg. And watching a movie. Quicktime with no fullscreen playback. <span class="caps">OUCH</span>.</p>

<p>I have <span class="caps">VLC</span>. It plays nicely .avi etc files. Then there are Perian plugin for Quicktime which makes xvid&#8217;s and stuff work in Quicktime. Also you can use iTunes or FrontRow to view your movies. Frontrow is nice if you have macbook plugged into tv. Also having photos in iPhoto makes it super easy to show photos. Just sit on the sofa and use remote =)</p>
