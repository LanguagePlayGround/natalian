<p>Actually, the clitoris is the only thing I don&#8217;t particularly like about my Thinkpad&#8212;I suffer from <span class="caps">RSI</span>, and I speak from experience when I say a trackpad is more ergonomic. I&#8217;ve had to buy a mouse.</p>

<p>As for hibernation, surely MacOS has a configuration tool for on-closed-lid actions, like other operating systems?</p>

<p>How do you like the keyboard? My friends here have low-end MacBooks with keyboards that look like the one on the picture there and I&#8217;m not very enthusiastic about them&#8212;though you can&#8217;t really judge a keyboard until you have used it for a while, which I haven&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a line I tend to get from women on seeing my x60s: &#8220;what a <span class="caps">CUTE</span> computer! But I&#8217;m disappointed you haven&#8217;t got a Mac.&#8221;&#8212;wtf?</p>
