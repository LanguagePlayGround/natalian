<p>&gt; I was surprised how to listen an mp3, you have to copy the file into Itunes. Omg. And watching a movie. Quicktime with no fullscreen playback. <span class="caps">OUCH</span>.</p>

<p>So, install mplayer. ;)</p>

<p>&gt; ctrl+trackpad button is right click. <span class="caps">OMG</span>. Pain.</p>

<p>Use the other right click: Leave two fingers resting on the pad and hit the button with your thumb.</p>

<p>&gt; I am slowly starting to discover the shortcuts and how to manage Windows.</p>

<p>Expose!</p>
