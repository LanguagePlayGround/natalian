<p>Since the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/5day.shtml?id=2053">weather in Woking</a> sucks today, I went out to buy some waterproof trousers to go over my jeans. 50GBP! That&#8217;s the nylon ones, not fancy pantsy <span class="caps">GORE</span> <span class="caps">TEX</span>.</p>

<p>So there is a &#8216;Green&#8217; &#8216;Environmentally friendly&#8217; scheme run by the UK government called <a href="http://www.evanscycles.com/ride2work.jsp">Ride2Work</a>, to help people get on their push bikes. When I asked <a href="http://www.evanscycles.com/">Evans bike shop</a> employees about the scheme, they said that the government scheme is so <strong>complicated</strong> Evans themselves have not managed to roll it out for their own employees.</p>

<p>More stupid <a href="http://natalian.org/archives/2007/10/24/nhs-registration/">government bureaucracy</a>? I must <a href="http://letter.dabase.com/">write a letter</a> to <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/humfrey_malins/woking">my MP</a>.</p>

<p>In other news, I was accidentally hanging around on the last Friday of the month outside the National Theatre (ugly building) and I noticed a lot of police. It turns it out it was <a href="http://www.criticalmasslondon.org.uk">Critical Mass London</a>. I must join next time&#8230;</p>
