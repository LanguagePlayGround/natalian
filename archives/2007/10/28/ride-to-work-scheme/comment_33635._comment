<p>The cycle to work scheme from the government isn&#8217;t that complicated. That Evans bike shop haven&#8217;t worked out how to roll it out for themselves is pretty strange. Most bike companies (small and large) I&#8217;ve heard of have managed how to do it, including the (shameless plug time) bike co I work for. They seem to be able to work the scheme, as most companies do, with the minimum of hassle. It is a great idea. I&#8217;m cycling 17 miles each way to work on a nice Specialized Allez thansk to the ride 2 work scheme and I&#8217;m grateful to whom ever came up with it for getting me nice bike cheaper than I would have otherwise.<br />
