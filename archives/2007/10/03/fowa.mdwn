<h4>Day 1</h4>

<ul>
<li>Wifi doesn&#8217;t work with my new &#8216;Ipod touch&#8217;. I am guess because of the odd <span class="caps">WEP</span> key length&#8230;</li>
<li>It hardly works with my Thinkpad. Timeouts all over the shop. :(</li>
<li>Lost an earlier WP post as the wifi timed out and the back button didn&#8217;t seem to work. :(</li>
</ul>

<p>Hate this Apple bashing that they aren&#8217;t opening up their platform. Keeping it with just the Web platform is an incredibly sensible move. &#8220;Opening&#8221; their (proprietary) platform will increase fragmentation&#8230; we should all be aiming for Web convergence. One Web platform for all.</p>

<p>Why don&#8217;t people bash Microsoft&#8217;s Silverlight or Adobe&#8217;s <span class="caps">AIR</span> ffs? It&#8217;s not the Open Web! I am sick and tired of Flash even. Can&#8217;t we recognise for the burden it is on the &#8220;open standards&#8221; Web??</p>

<p>A business model to be bought by Adobe. Great&#8230; <strong>not</strong>. This is not the open Web imo. People positioning themselves to be eaten up by a monopoly.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t understand tagging. Why isn&#8217;t it in the same as &#8220;categories&#8221; in Wordpress? Should I be migrating my categories to &#8220;tags&#8221;? <span class="caps">WTF</span>! Thankfully Matt is around&#8230; :)</p>

<p>My thinkpad X40 hard drive is crashing&#8230; this happened about a <a href="http://natalian.org/archives/2006/10/19/where-was-i/">year ago</a>!</p>

<li>Wireless has slightly improved, no DUPs&#8230;</li>
<li>Still ill with some sort of infected chest :(</li>
<li>Converting my categories to tags on my blog. Doesn&#8217;t seem to be going too well.</li>
<li>Comet looked like a hacky <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)"><span class="caps">AJAX</span> push implementation</a>. I wish JS didn&#8217;t look so darn flaky.</li>
<li>Enjoyed <a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/">Tom Coates</a> presentation on the location service code named <a href="http://fireeagle.research.yahoo.com/">FireEagle</a></li>
<li>Commented to <a href="http://simonwillison.net/">Simon Willison</a> (great host btw) we really could have done with a proper presentation on HTML5. That&#8217;s the Future of Web Apps!</li>
