<p>@Jamie, I don&#8217;t mind bashing MacOSX, Apple&#8217;s native platform. It suckity sucks. Package management sucks. Windowing sucks. Mouse/keyb sucks. I&#8217;d rather use a really open and free as in freedom OS like Debian.</p>

<p>I currently do this via vmware. Anyway I need to play around with Macs for work.</p>

<p>I still use my X40 and Debian for all my personal non-Aplix work stuff. What more can I do?</p>

<p>I know this doesn&#8217;t sound intuitive, though I&#8217;d rather be restricted to an open Web platform, than allow hacking a proprietary one.</p>
