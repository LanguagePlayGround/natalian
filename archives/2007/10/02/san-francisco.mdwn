<p>Last week I was in the <span class="caps">USA</span> for the first time. It was great. My employers <a href="http://www.aplixcorp.com">Aplix</a> sent me out to an <a href="http://www.w3.org/News/2007#item197">Ajax conference</a>. Also see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/06/mobile-ajax/papers/">accepted paper</a> I submitted.</p>

<p>My first impression was the yellow colour scheme that the place seem to have. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_investigators">3 investigators</a> country. :) The place is a bit more Asian than I expected. McDonalds sign just in Chinese&#8230;</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re wondering why I was so slow with <a href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/w/wordpress/news/20071002T071707Z.html">2.3 release</a> of Wordpress, it was because I was at the <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/269586/">release party</a>. Awesome to meet <a href="http://photomatt.net/">Matt</a> and surprisingly <a href="http://diveintomark.org/">Mark Pilgrim</a> and <a href="http://tantek.com/">Tantek Celik</a>. Geek paradise! The conversations seemed much &#8220;higher bandwidth&#8221; or perhaps more stimulating than conversing before.</p>

<p>I also met with some other excellent friends that I&#8217;ve met on my <a href="http://maps.natalian.org/">travels</a>. I even bumped into my old <a href="http://natalian.org/archives/2004/10/03/web-engineering-for-mobile-devices/">Professor from school</a>!</p>

<p>The troubling thing I found with the place was the homeless/beggars. I took a moment or two to chat with a couple and I was amazed to find them so articulate. One guy had some pretty good poetry. I didn&#8217;t probe further, except I did read through the &#8220;Street spirit&#8221; paper. Bit depressing. My Californian friends says there are so many homeless people here, because California has the best homeless policies and the best weather. Probably some truth in that.</p>

<p>I like a croissant in the morning and I found the croissants a bit gross really. Yes I randomly sampled a couple of places. Had some great meals at &#8220;House of Nanking&#8221; and <em>heavy</em> breakfasts at &#8220;Sears fine foods&#8221;. They seem really popular tourist hits, though they were good. Bit disappointed by the Clam chowder and seafood on offer really. Guess you need to splash out. Coffee is good &amp; smooth, though I am not used to it and it really felt painful after a couple of refills.</p>

<p>Jet lag sucked. Now I am back in the UK, I feel much better. Though I still have some sort of chest infection to work through.</p>

<p>Let me think. The highlights were absorbing the view from my hotel window on the 29th level. Riding across the Golden gate bridge and surrounds. <span class="caps">AWESOME</span>. Super friendly and helpful people. Shopping was also a great experience.</p>

<p>I found Mountain View and that sort of &#8220;campus culture&#8221; really <strong>really</strong> boring. Reminds me of Bath University. I couldn&#8217;t live there or in the suburbs. It either has to be city or proper country for me. I know I now live in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woking">Woking</a>, though Woking is only 30mins from London. That&#8217;s London and a bit of green. ;)</p>

<p>Darn I miss the weather in California&#8230;</p>
