<p>I commuted in the rain. My commute is by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_bike">push bike</a> from Woking to Guildford and back. About 15 miles a day. It&#8217;s OK when it doesn&#8217;t rain. Today it poured.</p>

<p>I am soaked. My jeans are soaked. My <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/hendry/tags/drillium/">drillium</a> jacket didn&#8217;t keep my dry, I&#8217;m returning it. :(</p>

<p>I hate how the water seems to collect in the bike paths (leftside of the road, there are no &#8216;real&#8217; bikepaths on my route). So you can&#8217;t see the drain holes, so it can be dangerous.</p>

<p>Need to buy some polyester trouser waterproofs for 50GBP. Nicer <span class="caps">GORE</span> <span class="caps">TEX</span> ones cost 110GBP from <a href="http://www.evanscycles.com/stores.jsp#store_160">Evans</a>. Damn, riding is expensive. I wonder how to keep my glasses free from the rain. Probably need to buy a cap.</p>

<p>I like to think I do <strong>my bit</strong> for the environment by not having a car. Though I am thinking I really need to buy a car. Despite cars being the <strong>most environmentally damaging element</strong> out there. <a href="http://climatedenial.org/2007/09/18/death-of-a-thousand-tips/">Not plastic bags</a>.</p>

<p>Taking the right action is hard. Getting in a fuss over recycling and donating money to charity or other cons like &#8220;carbon offset&#8221; schemes is stupid and all too easy.</p>
