<p>I&#8217;ve been proud of the <span class="caps">NHS</span>, especially since seeing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicko/">the movie sicko</a>. Though recently I&#8217;ve had some troubling experiences.</p>

<p>First a friend of mine had trouble seeing a doctor. She had to wait several hours to see one in London and has had registration issues.</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;ve never had problems seeing a doctor in Cornwall. Though since I&#8217;ve moved to Woking, I&#8217;ve noticed the rules have changed.</p>

<ol>
<li>I develop chest infection and I need some antibiotics to go over this</li>
<li>Call up <span class="caps">NHS</span> helpline, they say I must go to the &#8220;walk in&#8221; community hospital</li>
<li>I find time to go to the &#8220;walk in&#8221; community hospital. After an hour wait, I see a nurse who is able to prescribe the antibiotics. She then says I should see my local doctor</li>
<li>I leave work early one day to go to the local surgery to register</li>
<li>Receptionist says I must make an appointment to see the doctor and besides I now must have my <strong>passport</strong> and a <strong>utility bill</strong> in my name with my new address in Woking</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t pay any utility bills (lucky me), though she said she&#8217;ll accept a bank statement which I had sent out especially for this (I usually look at my statement online)</li>
<li>I attend the new appointment a few days later after</li>
<li>Wait 30 minutes and then see the doctor</li>
<li>Doctor asks if I have been registered in the UK before (yes). He then says he&#8217;ll accept me as a patient and then he asks me to fill in some forms.</li>
<li>He says he can&#8217;t treat me until I&#8217;ve filled in the forms and registered. Registration takes about three working days.</li>
<li>I fill in the forms. Why do have to say what race and religion I have?</li>
<li>Made another appointment next week, by then I&#8217;ve hopefully been registered.</li>
</ol>

<p>These events have happened over 3 weeks now. Nevermind the work hours I&#8217;ve lost. And still I have not properly seen a doctor.</p>
