<p>I noticed when my <a href="http://prazefarm.co.uk/curtains/">mother works on her curtains</a> she sometimes has Radio BBC2/4 on and other times not.</p>

<p>I asked her why is the radio off now? She says she needs to concentrate. She has it back on when the job gets routine.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the way I feel about it too. I never quite understood how programmers can work with music. If you&#8217;re working really hard on a problem, best have the music off with no disturbances.</p>
