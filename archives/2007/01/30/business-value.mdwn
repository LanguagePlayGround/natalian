<p>In the last days I have been surfing the Web thinking about business ideas and sometimes doing phone interviews. In any case I <strong>need</strong> reliable Internet. Like almost anyone out there.</p>

<p>Though today <a href="http://usertools.plus.net/status/archive/1170167479.htm">my <span class="caps">ISP</span> plus.net &#8216;s broadband service was down for most of the working day</a>. I complained when I got the Internet back eventually around 4pm and said: &#8220;My business is completely depedent on it.&#8221;.</p>

<p>Those cheeky assholes replied saying &#8220;you are using this account for business purposes which is not permitted on a residential account. You will therefore have to upgrade to a business account within 30 days.&#8221;</p>

<p>What is the difference between a residential and a business account service? The contention rates &#8220;might&#8221; be better, though essentially it is the <strong>same product</strong> with <strong>added business value</strong>, i.e. more <strong>expensive</strong>.</p>

<p>This concept of <strong>business value</strong> is slightly disturbing. Add 20% if you want a &#8220;business PC&#8221; instead of home PC (same spec). Get more bank charges if you have a <strong>business bank account</strong> (business value). And in the case of this dire <span class="caps">ISP</span> plus.net, pay more for the same crap service.</p>
