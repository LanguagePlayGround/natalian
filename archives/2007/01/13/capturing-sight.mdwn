<p>I thought struck me this morning after visiting a <a href="http://www.hortamuseum.be/">Art Nouveau museum in Brussels</a>, that prohibited photography. The contemporary issue of photographer rights.</p>

<p>As usual I would like to share my <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/hendry/">pictures</a> with you guys and perhaps even blog about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a>. Initially I thought it might be a good idea to prevent photography in small museums because it prevents amateurs taking pictures all the time and getting in the way of other people.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t you hate when amateurs can&#8217;t control their flash properly?</p>

<p>Or when people waste too much time with a 1.3 megapixel camera phone. Your photos will always be crap. Sorry. Don&#8217;t waste your time or mine.</p>

<p>I searched around and found only <a href="http://www.sirimo.co.uk/ukpr.php">one good resource for photographer rights</a>. It seems to differ country-by-country. I have seen some strange things in some countries. Like in Brasil there was some official looking sign that told you when and when not to take pictures. Very odd.</p>

<p>I feel like a radical by suggesting simply <strong>you have every right to capture what you see</strong>. You can&#8217;t police it or prevent it. In fact I was reading somewhere on <span class="caps">BBC</span> News that judges don&#8217;t try to stop pictures being published nowadays, instead encouraging complainants to sue.</p>
