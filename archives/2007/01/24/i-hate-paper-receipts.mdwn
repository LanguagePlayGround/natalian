<p>I&#8217;ve had another pair of <a href="http://www.meindl.de/">Meindl</a> shoes fuck up on me after 3 months of use and I wanted to return them.</p>

<p>Problem: Oh no! I can&#8217;t find the receipt. God knows what I&#8217;ve done with it. Sound familiar?</p>

<p>Solution: I really hope the days of paper receipts are numbered. If I had purchased the shoes and returned them to a store, with say a loyalty card, I wonder then would I still need a silly little paper receipt?</p>

<p>Conclusion: I don&#8217;t think stores want to make it too easy to return faulty goods. Assholes.</p>
