<p>A couple of days ago I was enjoying my X40 in my lap (haha, you can&#8217;t do that with a Macbook!). I was leaning back, putting my feet up. &#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s comfortable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then I was called downstairs for tea. I put my lovely laptop down on the desk and hobbled away. I say &#8220;hobbled&#8221; because I had a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_leg">dead leg</a>.</p>

<p>Then I hear a painful sliding noise to see my <span class="caps">LAPTOP</span> <span class="caps">FALLING</span> <span class="caps">SLOW</span> <span class="caps">MOTION</span> to the <span class="caps">GROUND</span>.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t noticed I had the bloody power cord wrapped around my numb leg.</p>

<p>Thankfully the Thinkpad shows no signs of damage. Though I&#8217;ve broken a good pair of Philips SHM6100. :(</p>

<p>It stressed me out the whole day that I could have broken my laptop that easily. I can&#8217;t afford for it to be replaced! Computer stuff being one&#8217;s life can be quite sad. ;)</p>
