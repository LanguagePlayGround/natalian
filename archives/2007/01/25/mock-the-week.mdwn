<p>In order to re-integrate back with British society I watched the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo/programmes/?id=mock_week">Mock the Week</a> TV programme on BBC2 as recommended by <a href="http://www.mightyv.com/">mightyv users</a>.</p>

<p>The programme is a cross between &#8220;Have I got news for you&#8221; and &#8220;Whose lines is it anyway?&#8221;. This TV innovation is rather unoriginal. How about something new TV? Nah, I guess you&#8217;re dead.</p>
