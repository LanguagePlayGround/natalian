<p>Being accused of racism is very difficult to argue about. Nowadays you seem to be either a racist or not a racist.</p>

<p>Calling someone bigoted however, might open a debate about what they&#8217;re bigoted about.</p>

<p>You see I think there are different degrees of racism and bigotry. It&#8217;s not black&amp;white.</p>

<p>I have faced people&#8217;s intolerance to me on countless occasions, because I am a white South African. It was probably the worst when I began my A-levels in the UK in 1996. That was a very hard time for me at 16 years of age. I&#8217;ve also observed a lot of bigotry in Australia.</p>

<p>So here I am accusing the UK and Australia of bigotry. Two Anglo cultures proud of their cultural &#8220;diversity&#8221;. Please wake up and address the problem(s) of intolerance with debate.</p>

<p>Currently discussions are thrown out the window with this either I am &#8216;bad&#8217; or I&#8217;m not &#8216;bad&#8217; mentality. People are offended to think otherwise. So stupid. It&#8217;s only natural to have fears of the unknown, to experience cultural clashes. It what makes this world interesting.</p>
