<p>I&#8217;ve always regarded the weather as a bit unpredictable.</p>

<p>Ok, the winter weather here is a little mild. Daffodils coming out to bloom now is&#8230; a little strange, I think. Well, I am not convinced.</p>

<p>Then I mistakenly turn on the TV tonight to catch <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/media/fullstory.aspx?id=10289">Climate Change: Britain Under Threat</a>. Which makes one feel like we are at war not just with Iraq, Afghanistan&#8230; but now with bloody mother nature.</p>

<p>Scary. Interesting. I seem to notice earthquakes far more. A Korean friend reported one last Saturday, and look here&#8230; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6284339.stm">another one</a>.</p>

<p>Great, more things to worry about.</p>
