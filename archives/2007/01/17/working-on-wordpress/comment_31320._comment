<p>Hi Mike,</p>

<p>I am contact with Ryan Boren and he says it isn&#8217;t. Also if you look at the bug report #407289, it does mention the affected parts of Wordpress. Diffing 2.0.6 and 2.0.7 shows that area isn&#8217;t corrected.</p>

<p>Thinkpads rule! Well, with Lenovo and their hard drives being rubbish. Sorta. :)</p>
