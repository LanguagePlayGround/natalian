<p>Adam, on point two. I am talking about the processes being open, not the data. :)</p>

<p>Thanks for the extra information.</p>

<p>I came across some sort of <a href="http://blindside.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">government focused IT &#8220;think tank&#8221;</a> who were trying to tackle problems like Robot rights and ID-enable&#8230; <span class="caps">HOLD</span> ON.</p>

<p>I questioned the guy last Friday during his speech to tackle the <span class="caps">REAL</span> <span class="caps">ISSUES</span>. Like this absolute fiasco&#8230; :/</p>
