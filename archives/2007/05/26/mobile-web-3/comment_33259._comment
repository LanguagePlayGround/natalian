<p>Kai,</p>

<p>Here at .mobi we like to think about .mobi as a way to honour the user&#8217;s mobile context rather than seeing it as a device-dependant web. There is nothing about .mobi sites that prevents them from working on a desktop browser (they are supposed to default to <span class="caps">XHTML</span>-MP, which works on all of the major browsers). So, rather than targeting pages to a mobile <strong>device</strong>, good mobi sites present views of information that make sense to users in a mobile <strong>context</strong> (which could easily be someone using a PC/laptop). I personally use .mobi (and other mobile sites) on my laptop quite often, specially when I am using my phone as a modem :-)</p>
