<p>I also never found the windows metaphor very useful. My usual setup is 9 virtual desktops, each with a maximized window (one for emacs, one for browser, several terminal desktops, etc).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s interesting that most people regard web interfaces as being easier to operate &#8211; I think the lack of windows is one of the biggest advantages.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t see the value of a name like &#8220;Web Operating System&#8221;, though. Perhaps &#8220;Web Desktop&#8221; would do better, since this is really the thing that&#8217;s being replaced.</p>
