<p>For the first time in <strong>years</strong> I&#8217;ve watched a bit of TV. I blame the earlier <a href="http://natalian.org/archives/2007/04/29/rented-internet/">lack of Internet</a> I unfortunately experienced.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s <strong>so</strong> bad, isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>Like today I am amazed how the <span class="caps">BBC</span> have flogged the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/haveigotnewsforyou/">&#8220;Have I got news for you&#8221;</a> show. It was on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cgi-perl/whatson/search/advance_search.cgi?keyword=have+i+got+news+for+you">yesterday Friday night and they repeated again today on Saturday night</a>.</p>

<p>They must be really out of ideas if they have to repeat that old show (33rd series) on two prime time night slots.</p>

<p>No wonder things like Youtube are popular. Just the quality is a bit disappointing. How come things have to get worse before they get better?</p>

<p>Mobile TV I recall in Korea was big. Though high speed net worked on the tube and it doesn&#8217;t work at all in the London underground. Korea had some whacky channels, that even I found somewhat interesting. I actually didn&#8217;t mind watching a few snippets of a Starcraft game or some crazy Asian show I didn&#8217;t understand.</p>

<p>As for user generated content and what not. I <strong>would like</strong> to make better <a href="http://video.natalian.org/">video</a>. Though the video my Nokia E65 &#8220;generates&#8221; is worse than crap. And unfortunately I&#8217;m not a Mac fanboy and I have not shelled out a thousand pounds for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_cut_pro">final cut pro software</a>. Free software video tools aren&#8217;t quite there yet&#8230; :/</p>

<p>I also found those OnDigital setup boxes in my &#8216;house share&#8217; really terribly slow. What a horrible experience flicking through the zillions of crap channels.</p>

<p>I like something really different and/or quality and I am not getting either from TV in the UK.</p>
