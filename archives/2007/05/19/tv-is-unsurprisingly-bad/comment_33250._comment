<p>I think that those Korean shows were interesting only because we couldn&#8217;t understand them at all! There are some good shows on tv, but very few of them are. Planet Earth is awesome. I think that <span class="caps">BBC</span> is one of the producers, so check it out. It took them years to make and the episodes are quite impressive.</p>
