<p>&#8220;Theft&#8221; is when you take something from someone, and they don&#8217;t have that thing any more, because you have it.  This is &#8220;copyright infringement,&#8221; which is not theft.  It&#8217;s very refreshing that you were so clear on your choice of words.  I guess the next step is figuring out what they actually mean.</p>
