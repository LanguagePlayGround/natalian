NOTE: I am providing these fonts for foreigners with an interest in Chinese who might otherwise have a hard time finding these fonts. While I don't mind links to this page, please do not link directly to the fonts, and please do not link to this page on any Chinese website, as I will be forced to take down this page if there are too many hits. Also, these <a href=\"http://www.fortuneave.com/credit-reports.html\">credit report</a> were originally tested on a computer which runs Windows XP, Chinese edition, so there's a chance that they won't work on your system. If they don't work, that's why.
