<p>I usually have a steaming cup of <a href="http://www.tetley.co.uk">Tetley</a> (milk, no sugar) tea with my raisin bran.</p>

<p>Today I decided since I did not have too much milk resulting in the bran being quite dry, to pour in some tea from my cup.</p>

<p>It did not taste too good.</p>

<p>What do you have for breakfast?</p>
