<p>Sorry about:</p>

<ul>
<li>The downtime</li>
<li>The fact that comments are still not working</li>
</ul>

<p>Big news is:</p>

<ul>
<li>I am graduating in April</li>
<li>I will be going to Australia very soon for work</li>
</ul>

<p>The celebrations of the former are subdued as I am worried about the latter:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have very little money (I wonder if I can afford the ticket there)</li>
<li>Visa time is running out in Lao</li>
<li>Internet connection sucks here</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t even have a suit (Perhaps I&#8217;ll get a 80USD one in Bangkok)</li>
<li>I have no place to stay in Australia</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t think I have any Australian friends</li>
<li>I have no computer</li>
<li>I have no job waiting for me there</li>
</ul>

<p>Hehe, life can be exciting.</p>

<p>Update: Kazakhstan offer with <a href="http://www.easy-world.kz/">Easy World</a> is still on. It&#8217;s an exciting place to be, especially with <a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Akayev_flees_Kyrgyzstan_as_protesters_seize_control_of_Bishkek">news of Kyrgyzstan</a></p>

<p>There I would hope to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Learn Russian (Read Nubokov in the original!)</li>
<li>Become a (young) sexpat</li>
<li>Eat devastating amounts of Caspian beluga caviar</li>
</ul>
