<p>Tried <a href="http://www.unknowngenius.com/blog/wordpress/spam-karma">Spam Karma</a> the last few days and yeah it worked! It stopped spam, but it also stopped <a href="http://kitten-x.com">Jamie</a> and I from posting comments. The options are confusing and perhaps somehow my IP got on the blacklist. I can&#8217;t tell because I do not know or care what my IP is. When a comment is blocked, it has a <strong>really</strong> stupid &#8220;bad karma man&#8221; message. It would be much better if it linked somehow into filing a complaint which I could then rectify. Daft and de-activated.</p>

<p><a href="http://mookitty.co.uk/devblog/category/kittens-spaminator/">Spaminator</a> just seems to use regular expressions to kill comment spam. However this is what Wordpress 1.5 already does in Options->Discussion. So that&#8217;s pointless.</p>

<p>So I am sticking with the defaults for now again. This sort of problem should be fixed in the trunk anyway.</p>

<p>Update: FS comment posting still does not seem to work. I&#8217;ll deal with this another time.</p>
