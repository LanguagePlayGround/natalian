<p>A Microsoft machine seems to be infected with some <span class="caps">GAIN</span> spyware. I thought I&#8217;ll just go and download <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/spyware/software/">Microsoft&#8217;s Spyware</a> instead.</p>

<p>Except it wants you to validate your Windows with an <span class="caps">EXECUTABLE</span>. How scary is that?</p>

<p>I swear I could choose to avoid the <strong>validation check</strong> in the past. So how do I do it now?</p>
