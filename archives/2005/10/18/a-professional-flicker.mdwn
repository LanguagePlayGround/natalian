As I don't have a credit card, nor want one I investigated paying "Ludicrop Research and Development aka Flickr":http://www.flickr.com/account_order_faq.gne#alternative 24.95USD via International Money Order.

<p>The Western Union money order from Australian post costs 8.65AUD. And I would have to pay additional postal charges including an envelope. Argh, <strong>pain</strong>. There is at least an additional 30% charge to pay Flickr via this method. Not to mention it&#8217;s <a href="http://letter.dabase.com/">snail mail</a> slow.</p>
