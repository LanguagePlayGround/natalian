<p>Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the <strong>shitlist</strong>.</p>

<p>Blogs in this category will contain a little rant about something or someone that&#8217;s polluted my inner peace and pissed me off.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.dlink.com.au/"><span class="caps">STUPID</span> D-link Australia.</a></p>

<p>At work we have a faulty modem/router <span class="caps">DSL</span>-504G crap that continually needs to be power cycled to get working.</p>

<p>D-link says we can return it on a <span class="caps">RMA</span> and get it replaced within a couple of days.</p>

<p><span class="caps">BUT</span> <span class="caps">HOW</span> <span class="caps">CAN</span> A <span class="caps">BUSINESS</span> DO <span class="caps">BUSINESS</span> <span class="caps">WITHOUT</span> <span class="caps">INTERNET</span> <span class="caps">FOR</span> <span class="caps">TWO</span> <span class="caps">DAYS</span>?</p>

<p>What you should have done D-link is this: Replaced the stupid piece of hardware with something that works.</p>
