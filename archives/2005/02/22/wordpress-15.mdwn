<p>Please read the <a href="http://debian.natalian.org/wordpress/wordpress_1.5.0-1_i386.changes">changelog.</a><br />
And test this <a href="http://debian.natalian.org/wordpress/wordpress_1.5.0-1_all.deb">pre-release of Wordpress 1.5 for Debian <span class="caps">SID</span>.</a> Email me and <a href="http://blog.eltridente.org/">Teo</a> about serious problems. Although I do not think I will be able to fix them&#8230;</p>

<p>Since Internet where I am is <strong>so bad</strong>, I couldn&#8217;t check if the <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1584">vulnerabilities in Wordpress 1.2</a> have been fixed. :(</p>

<p>I hope <a href="http://blog.eltridente.org/">Teo</a> will smooth things over. I put myself as maintainer (I have been doing the last couple of updates), although this may need a <span class="caps">NMU</span>.  :/</p>

<p>First impressions of Wordpress 1.5 are not great. I still have 1000+ comments that need moderating and interface still seems to suck. I need to regex all those poker/sex shit out of there. Apologies to my comment posters.</p>

<p>Ok, I am going for a dip in the pool to cool down.</p>
