<p>I didn&#8217;t want to rant about politics on my blog, but I am an opinionated bastard and today I just couldn&#8217;t help myself.</p>

<p><span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">NEXT</span> SA <span class="caps">PRESIDENT</span> <span class="caps">WILL</span> <span class="caps">NOT</span> BE <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">ALLEGED</span> <span class="caps">CRIMINAL</span> <span class="caps">ZUMA</span>!</p>

<p>Mbeki finally <a href="http://iafrica.com/news/sa/450645.htm">fired Zuma.</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately <a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikinews</a> didn&#8217;t report on this and I could have come up with a lengthy story myself if I had the time. Zuma has been suspected on being a double agent for the SA govn. Arms deals. Money disappearing, oh you name it.</p>

<p>Oh yes, this is <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4092064.stm">great news.</a></p>
