<p>I strayed onto <a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog/2005/06/04#1311">Ted&#8217;s blog and an entry about laptop microprocessors.</a></p>

<p>I have been thinking whether to buy a <span class="caps">IBM</span> Thinkpad refurb using a Pentium M(T41) or a <span class="caps">PIII</span> processor(X31, mobile!). I have been told there is little difference between the two.</p>

<p>Intel on the microprocessor front tend to be stupidly bad recently. They have fecked up that old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore&#8217;s Law.</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately their competition <span class="caps">AMD</span> doesn&#8217;t have a mobile processor.</p>

<p>Anyway, the interesting news is <a href="http://news.com.com/PC+milestone--notebooks+outsell+desktops/2100-1047_3-5731417.html?part=rss&amp;tag=5731417&amp;subj=news">Laptops out sell Desktops.</a></p>

<p>I predicted this years ago, to myself.</p>

<p>Of course I am not going to buy an Apple Laptop. It&#8217;s proprietary hardware (AIRPORT) and the <span class="caps">PPC</span> to x86 switch will take years. Well, someone at the last Linux user meeting suggested <span class="caps">OSX</span> x86 port leaking, but I didn&#8217;t expect it <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/06/12/130234&amp;tid=179&amp;tid=1">so soon.</a></p>
