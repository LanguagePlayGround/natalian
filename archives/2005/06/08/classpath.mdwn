<p>Just to continue my conceited Java blogging.</p>

<p>The thing I didn&#8217;t get with classpath is that you need to name the <span class="caps">JAR</span> file.</p>

<p><span class="caps">WRONG</span></p>

<p>export <span class="caps">CLASSPATH</span>=/u01/app/jboss-4.0.1sp1/client/</p>

<p><span class="caps">RIGHT</span></p>

<p>export <span class="caps">CLASSPATH</span>=/u01/app/jboss-4.0.1sp1/client/activation.jar</p>

<p>I even wrote a Web app to <a href="http://classpath.dabase.com">compare <strong><span class="caps">CRAP</span></strong> ant -verbose classpath output between Linux and Win32.</a></p>

<p>I hate <span class="caps">JAVA</span>. It is so difficult for me to track which <span class="caps">JAR</span> file say example javax.servlet.ServletException comes from.</p>
