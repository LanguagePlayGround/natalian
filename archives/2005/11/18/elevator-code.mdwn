<p>I take this lift/elevator at least 11 floors down and up every day. I stand outside comparing the display to the next lift and I can&#8217;t help but think how the software is designed.</p>

<p>For example: Sometimes the elevator just whizzes down past my floor without picking me up.</p>

<p>Is that because it&#8217;s going too fast?</p>

<p>Too many people?</p>

<p>Or has it&#8217;s logic has determined the other elevator is in a better position to pick me up in the near future?</p>

<p><strong>The mind boggles.</strong></p>

<p>When there is free/open source (or some sort of <span class="caps">ISO</span> standard?) for elevators I think it will be a <strong>significant milestone</strong> for human kind.</p>
