<p>Hey there,</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a response to your statement that &#8220;it doesnâ€™t look like [Django] is bringing anything new to the table.&#8221; Off the top of my head, Django offers the following things that Ruby on Rails doesn&#8217;t:</p>

<ul>
<li>Internationalization (you lamented Rails&#8217; lack of i18n in this post).</li>
<li>An automatic, production-ready administration interface.</li>
<li><span class="caps">RSS</span>/Atom syndication feed framework.</li>
<li>The Python syntax you know you love. :)</li>
</ul>

<p>You&#8217;ve got to take some time out to implement something in Django!</p>
