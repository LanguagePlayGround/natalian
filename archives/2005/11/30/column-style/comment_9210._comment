<p>something like:</p>

<p>pre, img {<br />
 max-width: 15em;<br />
}<br />
pre {<br />
 overflow: auto;<br />
}</p>

<p>The  will be made to scroll if it gets too wide and the  will be resized to fit.</p>

<p>With the  you could alternatively make it wordwrap with something like pre { white-space: pre-wrap } though making that work in all browsers is trickier.</p>
