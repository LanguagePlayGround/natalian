<p>At work we share a small office and today we took delivery of a SuperMicro SC823T based rack complete with a cabinet.</p>

<p><strong><span class="caps">FUCK</span> IT&#8217;S <span class="caps">LOUD</span>.</strong></p>

<p>I am really regretting purchasing it. A midi-tower or something would have been much quieter. Though that is not as flexible (could get it in a co-location) or professional as using a rack. I guess we need to somehow make a &#8220;server room&#8221;.</p>

<p>Oh crap, I have a headache coming on.</p>
