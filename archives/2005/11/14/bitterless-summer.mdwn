<p>Summer is here in Melbourne, so naturally I would sit in the sun with my favourite summertime drink.</p>

<p><a href="http://unadorned.org/dandruff/archives/2005/05/21/003240.html">Lemon, lime and bitters.</a> Except there is <strong>no bitters</strong> to be found in Melbourne.</p>

<p>According to Wig&#8217;s Cellar on Queen street, Angostura who manufacture the stuff have had production disrupted by a natural disaster. We can only assume any one of those several hurricanes that rip up the Caribbean nowadays.</p>

<p>Blast.</p>

<p>Though there are a couple of public houses which have the stuff.</p>
