<p>I initially tried mod_proxy, though the links that the JBoss Application generated were not coming out right. I think it needed mod_html_proxy too. It just didn&#8217;t work after repeated attempts.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got mod-jk working with Apache2 and I am happy with it for now.</p>

<p>Thanks Joose !</p>
