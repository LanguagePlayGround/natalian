<p>My routine with my digital camera:<br />
# Take pictures on camera which get stored on a compact flash disk<br />
# Put CF disk into external <span class="caps">USB</span> card reader<br />
# mount and cp files over to ~/pix/kodak<br />
# unmount and format the CF disk on camera</p>

<p>Unfortunately I was wrestling with Debian&#8217;s udev and never got the CF to bloody mount!<br />
<pre><br />
mount: special device /dev/sda1 does not exist<br />
</pre></p>

<p>Then without thinking I replaced the CF and formatted the disk! F#^$!</p>

<p>After <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=unformat+compact+flash&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official">Googling around</a> on my Windows work PC I found:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://diskinternals.com/fat-recovery/features.shtml">Fat recovery</a> which was useless because it didn&#8217;t see the <span class="caps">USB</span> external device</li>
<li><a href="http://www.panterasoft.com/file-recovery/">Flash file recovery</a> which worked, but required more than 60AUD to perform the actual recovery!</li>
</ul>

<p>Doesn&#8217;t panterasoft realize how much lifelong kudos I would have given them, if it worked? I might have actually paid 60 <span class="caps">AUD</span> if I was happy with the end results and had some spare cash. Anyway in absolute desperation I tried (after searching for crack, warez):</p>

<pre>
frodo$ apt-cache search fat recovery
mondo - powerful disaster recovery suite
mondo-doc - manual for Mondo, a powerful disaster recovery suite
testdisk - Partition scanner and disk recovery tool
</pre>

<p>And a later apt-cache show testdisk reveals <a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/index.html?photorec.html">PhotoRec.</a> /me salivates.<br />
<span class="caps">OMG</span>, thank god for Debian. Sadly I don&#8217;t have time to figure out how to make <a href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/u/udev.html">udev</a> create the /dev/sda1 device for my compact flash card so I downloaded the <a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/testdisk-5.8.win.zip">windows version</a> which works. Thank you Christophe Grenier.</p>
