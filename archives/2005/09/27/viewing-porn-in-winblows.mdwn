<p>One of the very very few things I like about using a Windows XP machines is the <strong>Windows Picture and Fax Viewer</strong>. This is one of Microsoft&#8217;s killer apps, as it is simple to use and works well. Printing is fantastic too. It can actually handle graphics over a megabyte, unlike previous versions of Windows.</p>

<p>Now, how does one restore the <span class="caps">JPEG</span> association with Microsoft&#8217;s image viewer once I&#8217;ve installed a stupid program which hijacks Images types!</p>

<p>Solution: Control Panel -> Folder Options</p>

<p>Sidenote: I still find Debian&#8217;s <a href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/f/feh.html">feh</a> <strong>best</strong> for viewing images. It is fast. Is there anything faster?</p>

<p>And while I am here, I also think Window&#8217;s dialup software rocks compared to anything I&#8217;ve seen in Debian when it comes to ease of use. Parent-proof.</p>
