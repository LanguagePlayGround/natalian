<p><strong>I hate Flash.</strong></p>

<p>I guess I am not the only one who noticed that <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&amp;q=google+video+flash+vlc&amp;btnG=Search+Blogs">Google has gone for Flash.</a></p>

<p>That&#8217;s a real shame for opensource.</p>

<p>If <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/"><span class="caps">VLC</span></a> wasn&#8217;t good enough, why not invest some money? You&#8217;ve got loads Google.</p>

<p>I think the real issue is probably because Flash is pre-installed. That&#8217;s the reality. Whoever gets their stuff shipped with Microsoft Windows is a winner.</p>
