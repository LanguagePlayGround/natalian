<p>Don&#8217;t bother with the Nano. You want something robust, reliable, and packed with features. Besides, why do you want to support a product that uses a proprietary database that you have to constantly manage? Vote with your wallet.</p>

<p>I would highly recommend you go for one of the Creative MuVo range. Just plug one into your usb port and its instantly recognised as a <span class="caps">USB</span> Mass Storage device. Mount it in Debian, or set up an automounting hotplug script, then simply copy folders of your tracks onto it, or individual tracks.</p>
