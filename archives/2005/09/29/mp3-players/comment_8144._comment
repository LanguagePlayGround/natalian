<p>carsten: The software is packaged for linux and is very easy to use. I have a script that automatically synchs the music, updates the playlists, rebuilds database, etc. The software is packaged for debian btw.</p>

<p>You can also use the &#8220;Rebuild Database&#8221; option under &#8220;Settings&#8221; to rebuild the databases if you don&#8217;t want to use the software.</p>

<p>I like my player, linux support is acceptable <span class="caps">IMHO</span>. Feel free to ask me about using it, since it works fine for me.</p>
