<p>I&#8217;d recommend the iAudio M3, it shows up as a <span class="caps">USB</span> mass storage device under Linux, has a model with 40Gb of storage, can play MP3 and Ogg Vorbis, has a radio built in and also supports voice recording to MP3.</p>

<p>The specs are at <a href="http://eng.iaudio.com/product/product_M3.php">http://eng.iaudio.com/product/product_M3.php</a></p>

<p>Some of the more recent iAudio players might also be good choices, but I have no personal experience with any of them.</p>
