<p>I know I&#8217;ve complained about Internet access in Australia <a href="http://natalian.org/archives/2005/05/31/australian-isps/">before.</a> It really is the bane of my existence.</p>

<p>At my hostel they&#8217;re offering only half an hour of &#8220;free&#8217; Wireless access. Any more and I have to buy drinks which are at least 2AUD every half hour. That also generally means re-logging in their ridiculous system.</p>

<p>On a side note, I only like to drink water nowadays. And as I think buying water is just stupid, life can be very difficult for me out.</p>

<p>So I am looking for an apartment in Melbourne. It&#8217;s simple. I need Internet (ok, and no pets as I&#8217;m allergic and wooden floors are a must too). 99% of flatshares do not have Internet as you need to take out a contract with Australian ISPs for at least 12 months. Many young professionals flat sharing are afraid to commit to any one place for 12 months. Me included.</p>

<p>As my geeks friends and I know, without regular Internet access it is very difficult to keep up with developments, esp. in the Open Source world. That really really sucks.</p>
