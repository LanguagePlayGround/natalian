<p>Every Sunday in Melbourne I go down to the <a href="http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/">State Library</a> to read <a href="http://www.private-eye.co.uk">Private Eye</a>, play some chess and perhaps give a speech outside at the &#8220;Speaker&#8217;s Corner&#8221;.</p>

<p>Last week I gave a speech about why <strong>Melbourne sucks</strong>.</p>

<p>I have given a speech on my travels, the Muslim religion (from my experiences in Pakistan) and almost did one about Organic food. I lost my notebook with the notes about Organic food, so I didn&#8217;t end up giving that one. I&#8217;ll always come up with some tirade when I meet an Organic salesman besides.</p>

<p>This week I was thinking of giving one about <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4482174.stm">science.</a> That&#8217;s because I fealt the need to <a href="http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1103151904&amp;count=1">explain <strong>evolution</strong></a> to many of those crazed Christians around and about, and throw in the interesting topic of climate change &#8220;denial&#8221;. It is very interesting reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Power">Wikipedia&#8217;s article on Nuclear Power</a>. From time to time I have to re-read it. It is definitely a hot current issue to wise up on.</p>
