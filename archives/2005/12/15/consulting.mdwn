<p>I have an ex-girlfriend with a business background that recently took a job with <a href="http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ACN">Accenture</a> as an IT Consultant.</p>

<p>I can tell you she doesn&#8217;t know anything about Computers. She barely manages to use hotmail.</p>

<p>She told me after an intensive one month of training she now knows everything is to know about VB and Java.</p>

<p>Christ, one has to wonder.</p>
