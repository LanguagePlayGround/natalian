<p>When webpage is <span class="caps">XHTML</span>, it would be easy to create <span class="caps">XSL</span>-T template for changing that <span class="caps">XHTML</span> to <span class="caps">XSL</span>-FO.. then eather browser would convert that <span class="caps">XSL</span>-FO to some more suitable form (PDF,PS,PCL&#8230;) or have the server do it (there are free implementations of <span class="caps">XSL</span>-FO renderers out there) if browser is incapable of doing it by itself.</p>

<p>I use <span class="caps">XSL</span>-FO to create very nice looking <span class="caps">PDF</span>&#8216;s. <span class="caps">PDF</span>&#8216;s can have vector graphics in it you know!</p>
