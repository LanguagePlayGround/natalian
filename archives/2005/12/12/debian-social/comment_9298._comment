<p>Well, you clearly have not used iTunes because you offer cplay as optional to iTunes. You try rhythmbox, it&#8217;s a nice try to mimic iTunes.</p>

<p>cplay is just a filemanager able to play files, doesn&#8217;t really differ from any commandline software.</p>

<p>Maybe you should try iTunes. See <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/overview/">http://www.apple.com/itunes/overview/</a> to even know something about iTunes.</p>
