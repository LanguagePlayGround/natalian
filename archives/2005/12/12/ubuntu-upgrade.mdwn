<p>Although the Package Manager annouces a new release called <strong>Breezy</strong> I couldn&#8217;t figure out to select it and upgrade to it.</p>

<p>In the end I had to edit the /etc/apt/sources.list and replace every occurance of hoary with breezy in vim.</p>

<p>The dist-upgrade requires 461MB to be downloaded. Holy crap that&#8217;s a lot. Lucky it&#8217;s just one machine atm at work otherwise I would have to spend time configuring some sort of apt proxy.</p>

<p>Every 6 months a release eh? They should make it a year.</p>
