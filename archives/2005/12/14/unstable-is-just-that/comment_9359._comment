<p><span class="caps">YES</span>! Such a service would be very useful. I think a debian.net page perhaps. A simple blog, or comments, or aggregation, or whatever, but <span class="caps">ONE</span> place where helpful people can report a serious unstable bug, timeframes, workarounds, etc. would be great.</p>
