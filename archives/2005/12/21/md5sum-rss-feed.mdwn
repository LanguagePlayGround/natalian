<p>Idea: Upstream publishes md5sums of releases which Debian can check with.</p>

<p>Pros<br />
* This makes it easier for maintainers<br />
* Better security for users<br />
* Piece of mind for upstream</p>

<p>Cons<br />
* Upstream will probably need some tool to generate the <span class="caps">RSS</span><br />
* Non-trivial to parse <span class="caps">RSS</span><br />
* Version number mismatch</p>
