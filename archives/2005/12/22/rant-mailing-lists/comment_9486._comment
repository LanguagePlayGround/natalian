<p>Google Groups? Usable? Please tell me you are joking.</p>

<p>Current irritation is that Google Groups seems to have blacklisted <strong>entire TLDs</strong>, including my usual one for mailing lists. I&#8217;ve never had a reply from their support. Google really doesn&#8217;t care about usability, as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>Mailman isn&#8217;t a good web interface, but at least much of it is emailable too. There are other list servers out there, some of which behave better, but none I like much today.</p>
