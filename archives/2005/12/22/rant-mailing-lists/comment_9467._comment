<p>I don&#8217;t know what to make of return paths. They&#8217;re generated by the <span class="caps">MTA</span> aren&#8217;t they? Some MTAs aren&#8217;t accessible (behind firewalls) like my laptop&#8217;s. And besides, I want my email sent to my From: or Reply-To: address ffs!</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t see why we can think that return-paths are legitimate and From: bogus. That&#8217;s daft.</p>

<p>Moderation. It just doesn&#8217;t seem to work ever <span class="caps">IMHO</span>. From emails to <span class="caps">IRC</span>. It just sucks.</p>
