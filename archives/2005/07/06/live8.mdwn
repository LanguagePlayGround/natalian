<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4654447.stm">Live8&#8217;s push for an ambitious G8 is a coverup of Iraq and Afghanistan.</a></p>

<p>A misguided scam, like most charities. I&#8217;m not afraid of generalising.</p>

<p>Local paper <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/">The Age</a> took the piss with last Saturday&#8217;s front page. Advertising bent African statistics as facts.</p>

<p>Bah! Infuriating.</p>
