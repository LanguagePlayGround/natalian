<p>One major feature missing from Wordpress was a decent spell check. I did have a setup where I edited the form in vim, but I kept on losing that configuration when swapping machines.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://toolbar.google.com/firefox">Google&#8217;s Firefox toolbar</a> which allows me to spell check my Wordpress posts.</p>

<p>Very cool.</p>
