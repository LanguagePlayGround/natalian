<p>Put in the 10g <span class="caps">DVD</span> and had permission denied errors when trying to runInstaller from /media/cdrom. Didn&#8217;t quite figure this out as the file did have exectution rights. Ended up copying the db directory from the installation CD to the ~oracle homedir.</p>

<p>&#8220;useradd -c &#8220;Oracle software owner&#8221; -g oinstall -G dba oracle&#8221; didn&#8217;t seem to create a homedir. Created one after by hand.</p>

<p>I hate Gnome terminal. So slow.</p>

<p>That terminal bell is so annoying.</p>

<p>xhost + didn&#8217;t work. Ended up just logging in again as newly created oracle user.</p>

<p>Had to install extra gcc package. Why does Oracle compile stuff on installation?! Those guys are &#8220;on crack&#8221;.</p>
