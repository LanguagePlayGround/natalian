<p>After seeing a <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008553.html">post by Russell about the <span class="caps">PSP</span></a> I decided to visit my local games store and try out a <span class="caps">PSP</span> demo device.</p>

<p>Funny how we call small things devices and larger devices machines.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was impressed by the screen. It&#8217;s huge. I played Ridge Racer a bit and it fealt great. I love how you can do backward turns in that game.</p>

<p>It seems to be limited to just 1Gig of flash memory. It&#8217;s probably designed so that you can&#8217;t share movies on a <span class="caps">USB</span> stick. I hate CDs so I was a bit disappointed to discover the proprietary Universal Media Disc(UMD).</p>

<p>I am not sure how the wireless works. The staff there seemed to think you can only connect to another <span class="caps">PSP</span>.</p>

<p>Battery life seemed a bit small. 3&#8211;4 hours. I guess that&#8217;s not too bad.</p>

<p>I would have loved to see the browser all the mobitopia geeks are talking about. Argh.</p>

<p>They will come out in September in Melbourne, at 399AUD.</p>
