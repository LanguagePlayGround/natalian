<p>Thanks for that information. Didn&#8217;t know about &#8220;chained&#8221; <span class="caps">SSL</span>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cacert.org/">http://www.cacert.org/</a> is free and installed in Debian&#8217;s browsers.</p>

<p>There is no web of trust in <span class="caps">SSL</span>! You must be joking. ;)</p>

<p>No user gives a hoot about CERTs in their browser. I don&#8217;t know 99% of the companies in my cert folder.</p>

<p>Thanks Joose for the comments :))</p>
