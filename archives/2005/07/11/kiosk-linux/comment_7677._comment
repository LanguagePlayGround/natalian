<p><span class="caps">PAM</span> isn&#8217;t used to store general data, <span class="caps">LDAP</span> is good for it.</p>

<p>Playing music from Firefox isn&#8217;t that difficult, we have plugins for that. Like quicktime plugin plays mp3 / wav / etc files when clicked. Of course if you want to play like 100 songs, then I&#8217;d still use plugin, but for streaming and using some streaming server to serve those songs..</p>
