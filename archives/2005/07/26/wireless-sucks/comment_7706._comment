<p>Price arguments. Yay.</p>

<p>When I setup my AP, I&#8217;ll happily let people use limited bandwidth for free. Of course, I don&#8217;t want someone hogging my pipe and disrupting my use of my connection.</p>

<p>I see the Internet like roads. I really don&#8217;t mind if people walk through my property if they keep to the path. Ideally roads should be maintained by the government or by the community, though I can manage my own path.</p>

<p>The cost to let someone temporarily access wireless net connection from a laptop is easily absorbed.</p>
