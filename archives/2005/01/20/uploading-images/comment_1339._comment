<p>psftp supports the &#8216;reput&#8217; command; no need for WinSCP for that.</p>

<p>As folks have said, the scp protocol doesn&#8217;t support resuming. That said, it would probably be possible to add resume support to pscp for when it&#8217;s operating in <span class="caps">SFTP</span> mode, which would be handy.</p>
