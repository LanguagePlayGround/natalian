<p><a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;q=Kai+Hendry">I survived that earthquake and Tsunami on last boxing day.</a></p>

<p>I always wanted to experience an earthquake but when I was awoken by what seemed to be someone tugging at my hammock that Sunday, it has been a living nightmare.</p>

<p>Maybe it is my present drab mood, however I feel that this has brought out the worst in people.</p>

<p>Oh the:</p>

<ul>
<li>Misinformation from authorities and the media</li>
<li>The panic</li>
<li>Terrible communications facilities</li>
<li>Mismanagement (the Indian bureaucracy!)</li>
<li>The looting</li>
<li>Increased amount of crocodiles, snakes and mosquitos</li>
<li>The water/petrol/electricity/alcohol shortages</li>
<li>The extortionate prices at times for travel and water</li>
</ul>

<p>Where I was on Havelock at the time, no one died. So it is difficult to contemplate about the thousands who have lost their lives.</p>

<p>I was supposed to fly to Bangkok on the 8/1/2005. As that flight is cancelled I will go back to Chennai on the 17/1/2005 by 3-day boat from Port Blair. I will travel around the south-west of India for a couple of weeks in order to waste winter time and meet a friend in Laos in February.</p>

<p>If I could stay longer on the Andaman I would. Fantastic <a href="http://www.barefootindia.com/">Jungle resort</a> food, Amazing Beach no.7 and the snorkelling on Elephant beach on Havelock is incredible. I hope the authorities allow tourists again as many local people depend on it. I hope potential tourists know that the North Andaman, especially the touristy locations such as Neil Island and Havelock are safe and well worth visiting.</p>
