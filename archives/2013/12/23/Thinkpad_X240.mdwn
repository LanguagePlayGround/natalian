So I must have been using the [Thinkpad X
series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad_X_Series) for about 10 years.

X40, X60, X201, X220 & I don't know what next. Help.

Of course I blame the [IBM handover to
Lenovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad#Acquisition_by_Lenovo) in 2005 as a mark
of decline.

I guess they are more "affordable" now then ever, though the deal breaker for me on the new X240 is:

The mouse keys feel terrible. I've always disabled the Trackpad, preferring
instead the [nipple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointing_stick), and now the
buttons are part of the Trackpad. They feel terrible.

The once famed keyboard has changed to a cheap [chiclet
style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiclet_keyboard) keyboard.

Astonishingly Lenovo changed the power connector AGAIN:

Old spare Thinkpad chargers can be thrown away.

# What next for running Archlinux?

Options are pretty thin:

I heard good things about the Samsung Series 9, but then Samsung annoyingly
changed the name to ATIV Book 9 Plus and added a touch screen. Really unsure.
No track point.

Macbook Air, then I'll have to juggle keeping a version of MacOSX running to do
firmware updates.
