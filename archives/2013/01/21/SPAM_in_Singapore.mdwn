I just got off the phone with M1. The procedure for reporting SPAM is:

1. Log 5 (yes, FIVE) complaints from the **same number**
* Report this to your local police station to get a police report
* Submit this report to M1

This is absurd. Even more absurd when in [[Singapore you can get charged for
incoming calls|archives/2012/11/29/Singapore_telecommunications]]. Even worse
if you are dumb enough to roam abroad with a Singporean SIM card.

(Samsung) Androids has nice feature of "Add to Reject list" when you long hold
the number in the recent call list. There is no such feature on IOS as far as I
know.
