There are 3 distinct demographics of cyclists on Singapore streets:

1. lycra clad Road bikers
* Folks on electric bikes (usually "uncles")
* Others, people are unpowered, fixies or just the crappy bikes

I'm a proud "other", riding a somewhat unusual Flying Pigeon owner. Ironically
taxi drivers tell me their fathers used to ride around like I do nowadays.
Flying Pigeons a generation or two ago probably outnumbered vehicles. It's a
real shame that Singaporeans have progressed to become child like monsters
behind the driving wheel.

Yes, it's DANGEROUS to ride on Singaporean streets. Fellow
[Hackerspacer](http://hackerspace.sg/) and Singaporean [Wee
Yeh](http://www.savecycling.com/) would have me believe that some drivers are
so annoyed by cyclists, that they would rather see them dead.  :(

It reminds me of the bad old days of cycling in London, which is now almost a
distant memory. A past when black cabbie drivers would scream abuse at you.
Things have changed in London, can they change in Singapore?

Singapore is a rich country where the culture is not shy of showing that
wealth. It's not uncommon to see Ferraris roaring down the same roads you might
be attempting to cycle down. It costs so much to license a car to drive here,
that I guess people are tend to look at cyclists with resentment.

What makes Singaporean drivers childish?

* do not use indicators
* switch lanes dangerously
* drive too fast
* not enough parking, so double / triple parking is not that unusual
* never give enough space
* dangerously cut you off at junctions is crazily common
* dangerous overtaking
* impatient
* some seem to pretend you don't exist (totally unapologetic)

What's the solution?

<http://www.savecycling.com> is collecting bicycle incidents. Not as morbid as
<http://ghostbikes.org/singapore>, though I generally see this as a "cure".

Some serious Singaporean government vision is needed and since no Government
ministers like [Boris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson) AFAIK seem
to cycle, I don't see this improving. Anyway if I had the power, I would:

* introduce a education campaign to drivers
* more speed checks
* somehow police **space** given to cyclists
* encourage people to cycle. close streets. get children interested.
* any incidents involving cyclists, its assumed its the car drivers fault
* introduce some facilities to cyclists, like place to lock them up!
