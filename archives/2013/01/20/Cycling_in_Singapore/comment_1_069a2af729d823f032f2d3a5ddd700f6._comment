Hey man, yeah, most local cyclists will tell you how much nicer it is with our friendly neighbours up north. I do my escapades into Malaysia and the drivers are sooo much better behaved.

Anyway, thanks for the heads up on savecycling.com. It's not quite ready. Will ping again when the web submission UI is up. :)
