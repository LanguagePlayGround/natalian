I'm shocked to hear [Aaron Swartz took his
life](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-21001452). I honestly I hope
it's a sick joke.

I had the pleasure to read / follow Aaron's [output](http://www.aaronsw.com/)
over the years. My earliest email exchange I can find is from 2005 where he
replied to a bug I filed on
[rss2email](http://www.allthingsrss.com/rss2email/). A really decent piece of
software I've recently started using again.

Then when Aaron released [web.py](http://webpy.org/) which I thought was
brilliant and timely. I offered to [package it for
Debian](http://packages.qa.debian.org/w/webpy.html) and we worked a little
closer for a year or two. Although I'm ~8 years older than him, I was learning
from him. I really liked his minimalistic style and he influenced me.

I went off the Python language altogether a year or two later and I think he
must have done well being a co-founder of
[Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/16fjjm/aaron_shwartz_reddit_cofounder_rip/)
et al, which I think was at least initially based upon webpy. We met for the
photo when I passing through San Francisco back in 2007 and I honestly feel
like I've had my picture taken with a famous person.

Of course I was alarmed when I heard he was getting
[indicted](https://twitter.com/kaihendry/status/93673377025363968). I have no
idea why he killed himself. I'm assuming he suffered from depression. I'm not
afraid to say depression affects me too, though thankfully not seriously.

So if you are reading this and feel down, you are not alone. My best advice is
to **travel**. Don't be afraid to ask people abroad like me for help! :)

Update: [This is pretty
damning](http://rememberaaronsw.tumblr.com/post/40372208044/official-statement-from-the-family-and-partner-of-aaron)
for Massachusetts U.S. Attorneyâ€™s office and MIT. Very sad.
