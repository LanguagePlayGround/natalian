2012 was an amazing year for me.

I moved to Malaysia at the end of 2011, still on a UK contract. I worked at
[Fluent Space](https://twitter.com/fluentspace) in Kelana Jaya which introduced
me to the co-working scene and some awesome people and ideas.

I switched to being full time on [Webconverger](http://webconverger.com), and
got into this [Web signage](http://neon.webconverger.com/) game.

In February 2012, I moved with Ruth to Singapore to largely "check Singapore
out". We liked what I saw.

In March 2012 I visited Hong Kong with Ruth which was great to check off. Later
that month a really good friend visited Singapore which was fantastic.

April I was slugging it out with my business with Patrick. Very intensive and
prolific work wise with a peer. We forged what Webconverger is today, the
configuration management, the innovative [git based
upgrades](http://webconverger.org/upgrade/), which I'm pretty proud of
achieving with the help of the
[community](http://webconverger.org/acknowledgements/).

At the end of May I moved back to Europe and then onto Berlin for a pre-planned
summer in Europe. It was an ambitious dream for Ruth and I, and it amazingly
worked out. We ended up living in an amazing affordable place and life was
awesome. Except Ruth's visa expires in 90 days since she's Malaysian, so we had
no choice but to leave. :(

Since I'm in love with Ruth and I was tired of the hassles dealing with visas,
I thought it was high time I proposed to Ruth with a especially made ring.

We moved back to Malaysia and
[[married|archives/2012/10/24/Getting_married_in_Malaysia]] legally on
2012-11-21. Then we moved back down to Singapore since Ruth managed to land a job
there.

This December was spent settling in and then things wound down for the Christmas
holidays, spent with the in-laws in Kuala Lumpur eating good food.

Overall I'm pretty torn between Europe and Asia. Though spending winter in this
region, enjoying the good food and challenges has been good.

# 2013

I'm a bit nervous about this year. I've resolved to get up earlier. Get fitter,
run (at least 4km) & swim (10 laps) twice a week.

Then there is stressful task of growing Webconverger. Also need to help get
Ruth's UK residence visa which is a ton of paper work. In all honesty I must
formulate a plan to get the right to stay in Singapore, which is quite tricky
if you (and your business) don't fit the mold.

In April I'm back in the UK for my bff Jamie's wedding. Since I can't afford to
fly back and forth between Singapore, I plan to live, plan & work with my
parents for two months leading up to my own Wedding ceremony in Cornwall,
without Ruth. I'm not looking forward to this. The Wedding, yes. Living without
Ruth, no.

After June, we'll move back Singapore, since Ruth is committed to working at
least a year in Singapore. Winning Ruth has definitely been the highlight of
2012 and that pervades into 2013. Though after June I hope to keep it exciting
and plot a new adventure. A honeymoon in Japan would be nice!
