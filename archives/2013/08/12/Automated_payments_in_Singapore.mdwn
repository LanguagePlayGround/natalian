In Singapore payment processes are still stuck in 90s. You need to raise an
invoice.  The payer typically writes a cheque. Cheque is typically sent by post
which takes two working days. And then it's cashed.

For personal accounts there is a recurring payments feature generally available
with online banking.

However if you have a business account, recurring payments are generally not
available with  online banking. YMMV

You have to go to your banking branch and take out either a:

1. [Standing order](http://www.standardchartered.com.sg/useful-forms/en/_pdf/application-form-for-standing-instruction.pdf)
2. [Giro](http://www.standardchartered.com.sg/useful-forms/en/_pdf/application-form-for-card-giro.pdf)

The standing order is for a fixed amount, and it costs 10SGD to setup. This makes it unpopular.

The Giro can take a month to setup and you get charged 10SGD for any amendments.

Giro grants the payee the right to debit the payer's account and is typically
used for things like utility bills which, because they have an unpredictable
component, can't be settled with a fixed monthly payment set up by the payer.

GIRO payments are instigated by the payer which needs to be a [GIRO billing
organisation](http://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/payments/additionalinfo/giro/girocorps/default.page),
not the payee, in order to "pull" money out of the payer's account.
