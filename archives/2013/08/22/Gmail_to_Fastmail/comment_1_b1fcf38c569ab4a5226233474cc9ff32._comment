I made the switch and seemed to have much less trouble than you.

> No automatic addressbook migration

I seem to remember reading somewhere that they are working on this, I think there's some standard which will allow them to integrate with smart phone/exchange servers..?

> I can't find my Gmail labels/folders of my mail

This is odd, all mine came through. I wonder if it's because Gmail uses labels where each mail can have multiple labels and FM uses folders where you can only have one per email.

> if I don't switch my forwards, my emails will get more out of sync as everyday passes.

Not sure what you mean by this, if you set up FM to fetch (ie, no forward involved) your Gmail emails I don't see a problem.

A few issues that I have with FM that you haven't mentioned:

* You can setup alternate logins, but you can't remove/disable your main username/password and force the use of the alternate logins, like you can force two step authentication with Gmail.
* It does seem a bit silly that you have to manually setup the bayes learning of spam and non-spam, once I'd done this my spam filtering was much improved, but I don't get why this isn't done automatically.
* There's no \"pinned\" view, like Gmail's starred view. The best you can do is set pinned to the top, but then you can't see your new mail, and this is slow.
* By default messages sent using their SMTP server [will not get added to your Sent folder](http://www.emaildiscussions.com/showthread.php?t=67315).
