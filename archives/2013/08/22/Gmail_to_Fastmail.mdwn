So I'm attempting to migrate my emails from Gmail to <https://www.fastmail.fm>.

Why? I don't like the privacy implications with Gmail and especially the new
[Gmail Compose UI](https://twitter.com/NewComposeSux).

# Need some support

So I signed up for a Fastmail trial and the thing that bothers me is that you
apparently don't get support unless you pay. But I don't want to pay until I
know I can successfully "on board" to Fastmail.

	PLEASE NOTE that we can *not* provide technical support to guest and
	member-level accounts; if you require technical support (other than
	billing/pre-sales support) with one of these accounts please click
	Options and then Upgrade Account to upgrade to Full, Enhanced or
	Premier level.

Sadly [fastmail do not do customer service over twitter](http://greptweet.com/u/kaihendry/#fastmail).

Tbh **fastmail support have come through for me**, despite not paying them yet!

# Annoyances

The first annoyance I ran into is the ridiculous default fastmail footer, which
I promptly removed. To those who have the same footer as defined your From:
address, you're are creating noise.

Next more serious issue is the **Migrate IMAP** UI wasn't friendly. Initially I wrongly used imap.google.com instead of imap.gmail.com and this message confused me:

	Could not connect to remote IMAP server SSL imap.google.com: Invalid
	argument at /home/mod_perl/hm/ME/ImapMigrate.pm line 269.

The Gmail seemed to refuse access to the account because it came from a New
York IP. This was eventually resolved, but it took some time. It's a bit
unnerving that Fastmail is hosted in the US, though I wrote to
privacy@fastmail.fm asking about it and they say although the <abbr
title="National Security Agency">NSA</abbr> can physically seize their
hardware, they would have to go through Australian law to access your account
through Fastmail.

# After "Migrate IMAP"

So this is a "one-time only action" and it doesn't do anything clever like
keeping your emails in sync with Gmail. So if I don't switch my forwards, my
emails will get more out of sync as everyday passes.

While the "Migrate IMAP" is happening, it looks rather strange, emails are
constantly being injected into the DOM. However once this "one time" process
finishes, I **can't find my Gmail labels/folders of my mail**!

# Hello Spam

Despite using Fastmail's [Global Bayes
database](http://s.natalian.org/2013-09-12/1378976530_1366x768.png), I am
getting a lot of spam.  Annoyingly sometimes from the SAME X-Mail-from:
address. Fastmail argue after time your personal database will become trained.

It's a shame that somehow when you move away from Gmail you can't bring along
your own "Bayes database".

# Goodbye filters, hello Rules

Gmail's filters work really well. I love the fact you can test and then apply them on email after the fact.

My experience with [Fastmail's Rules has not been good!](https://www.fastmail.fm/html/?MSignal=TZ-**370133*20ad96a2&u=148c411e) :(

# No automatic addressbook migration :/

I expected Fastmail to migrate the addressbook. But it doesn't. And it doesn't
seem to be able to gleam email addresses from my Gmail migrated mails. So at
first I wondered how best to [move my addressbook from Gmail to
Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.fm/html/?MLS=SU-*&STZ-TH=b054c299&STZ-TI=363101&u=148c411e&MSignal=TZ-**362785*48d2e245)

I've exported my contacts from <https://www.fastmail.fm/contacts/> using vCard
standard and imported them into <https://www.fastmail.fm/contacts/>. I have
something like 6k+ contacts thanks to Gmail's automagic adding of contacts.

A lot of the contacts could be pruned, but there is no sane UI to do that.

# Support replies not by email

If you get a reply from support, you will be shocked to see **DO NOT REPLY TO
THIS EMAIL. REPLIES WILL NOT BE MONITORED.** in their email body. You need to
click the link to use another form to reply. Weird.

The [password field on support tickets is also quite
jarring](http://s.natalian.org/2013-08-22/1377141130_1366x768.png) to me. I
should be logged in already!?

# [Shift+PGDN does not work](https://www.fastmail.fm/html/?MSignal=TZ-**363177*1cde45b9&u=148c411e)

Have to use `shift+alt+down` instead.

# Things that Fastmail has that Gmail seemingly doesn't

* I find the keyboard shortcuts much more usable on Fastmail
* You can easily the **oldest emails**, so I can see the first email between my wife and I from Aug 5 2005 in Melbourne!
* The [Fastmail.fm blog](http://blog.fastmail.fm/) is a very good read
* Their [servers are in the US](http://blog.fastmail.fm/2013/10/07/fastmails-servers-are-in-the-us-what-this-means-for-you/), but they are looking into ways of offering their service from non-US servers
