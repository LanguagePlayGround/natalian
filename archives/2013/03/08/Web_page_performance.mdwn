Prompted by people writing slow Websites in Singapore, and obvious tools like
[Google's PageSpeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/) not catching this class of error, allow me to educate you.

If you serve (the majority of your) customers in say Singapore, your Web server (httpd) should be in Singapore. Understood?

ICMP ping times to your host should be ~5ms.


If you run a non-optimised **bog standard** Apache2 httpd instance on that host, your
[httping](http://www.vanheusden.com/httping/) times should be about ~40ms. Understood?

If you don't want to install `httping`, you could use something like `time curl -I "http://sg.hackandtell.org"`.

	x220:~$ httping sg.hackandtell.org
	PING sg.hackandtell.org:80 (sg.hackandtell.org):
	connected to 117.121.241.187:80 (293 bytes), seq=0 time=28.76 ms
	connected to 117.121.241.187:80 (293 bytes), seq=1 time=31.89 ms
	connected to 117.121.241.187:80 (293 bytes), seq=2 time=25.64 ms
	connected to 117.121.241.187:80 (293 bytes), seq=3 time=23.24 ms
	^CGot signal 2
	--- sg.hackandtell.org ping statistics ---
	4 connects, 4 ok, 0.00% failed
	round-trip min/avg/max = 23.2/27.4/31.9 ms

Now if you are Google, you have machines all over the world and a clever DNS
system that makes sure you can served by the closest machine. I.e. if you are
in Singapore, you get your search query answered by a server in Singapore.

	x220:~$ httping www.google.com
	PING www.google.com:80 (www.google.com):
	connected to 74.125.235.49:80 (768 bytes), seq=0 time=74.84 ms
	connected to 74.125.235.49:80 (768 bytes), seq=1 time=32.56 ms
	connected to 74.125.235.49:80 (768 bytes), seq=2 time=42.33 ms
	connected to 74.125.235.49:80 (768 bytes), seq=3 time=42.97 ms
	^CGot signal 2
	--- www.google.com ping statistics ---
	4 connects, 4 ok, 0.00% failed
	round-trip min/avg/max = 32.6/48.2/74.8 ms


Now if your site has http ping times greater than 40ms, you have FUCKED UP.

	x220:~$ httping hackerspace.sg
	PING hackerspace.sg:80 (hackerspace.sg):
	connected to 208.97.177.38:80 (395 bytes), seq=0 time=1832.28 ms

	connected to 208.97.177.38:80 (395 bytes), seq=2 time=1550.14 ms
	^CGot signal 2
	--- hackerspace.sg ping statistics ---
	3 connects, 3 ok, 0.00% failed
	round-trip min/avg/max = 1550.1/1749.2/1865.2 ms

Yes, you can deploy all range of caching tricks to improve load times, but that
only happens if you have VISITED THE WEB PAGE BEFORE.

Please make the initial load times of your Webpage <40ms. If you can't afford
to have a httpd in every country of the world like Google, I recomend [Amazon
CloudFront](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/). Not
[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) which do have servers in lots of
countries, but they don't cache on that http level, they only reverse proxy
making their service slow, i.e. httpings >200ms.
