Since my wife Ruth is an interior designer and I have a good friend who is an
architect, it frustrates me that their work can't be easily viewed on the Web.

Furthermore when someone books my parent's
[cottage](http://www.prazefarm.co.uk/cottage/) or when I book accommodation
myself, you generally do not have a good idea of the physical space except for
a gallery picture.

Another use case is maintaining a building. It would be great to be able to
document how network cables run, how heating is zoned, how different electrical
circuits are isolated.

With that in mind I bought my wife a Bosch PLR 25 Digital Laser Range Finder,
to measure [Praze Farm](http://www.prazefarm.co.uk/)'s dimensions, and that
project was a little harder than previously imagined.

First step for Ruth was take loads of measurements and then step 2 re-draw the
building in [SketchUp](http://www.sketchup.com/). She used the previous
photo-copied floor plans as a guide, though it turns out in our "Grade 2"
[listed building](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listed_building) the walls were
not level. In the end it was so complex and tedious she gave up, much to my
disappointment.

Now with a dose of Science Fiction and Google's driverless cars pushing
[LIDAR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIDAR) technology, one can imagine a
device that can scan a building. The 3D data LIDAR collects could be
transformed in the 3D model. Great, two steps in one, with only detailing and
annotation of the design left to do!

Though what encapsulated format would this be in? Obviously we need something
that can be translated into WebGL with ease. So any browser equipped device can
explore and be informed by the detailed model. So far I don't think this
functionality exists, so isn't there a wonderful opportunity for development?
