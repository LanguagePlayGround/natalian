Definitely a difficult choice as to whether double the cost is worth it for double the speed, albeit still a painful upload.  Personally I wish it was possible to set a profile that sacrificed some of the download frequencies for more upload.

From looking at Samknows and BT infinity's broadband checkers, you can at least be sort-of cheered up to see they now more-or-less correctly predict 12Mb/s down, 1Mb/s up for your phone number.

The whole rural broadband thing seems to be an incredibly difficult problem.. fingers crossed for affordable FTTP, but I suspect even that will still leave people at a longer distance with a lesser connection; it's unlikely to ever match what will be available in cities, though hopefully it'll at least be adequate for normal use.
