Pre-2013, at <http://www.prazefarm.co.uk/> we had a "20CN" ADSL connection.

The very best broadband speed we could achieve is 6.26Mb/s down and 0.36Mb/s
up.  It's useless for uploads.

If you ignore the BT line rental tax of ~150GBP a year, we were paying about
20GBP a month for Internet via our esteemed ISP <a href="http://aaisp.net/"><abbr title="Andrews &
Arnold">A&A</abbr></a>.

# After Superfast Cornwall

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/8636259701/" title="ERDF Broadband infrastructure in Cornwall by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8540/8636259701_4ec8d0de3e.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="ERDF Broadband infrastructure in Cornwall"></a>

After a long nervous wait, we finally got <abbr title="Fibre to the Cabinet">FTTC</abbr> about a mile away from our property. Much closer than the
previous [Cardinham
exchange](http://www.flickr.com/photos/16105436@N00/5652770045/in/photolist-9BvVAv-eaa68k).

The cost of the upgrade was 100GBP with a 12 month minimum contract and we
received [two new modems](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/8676832125/). My
heart sank when we got the first new readings of our Superfast line. About
10Mb/sec down and 0.5Mb/s up. Useless for uploads. I thought this must be a
horrible error, since these new <abbr title="Fibre to the Cabinet">FTTC</abbr> readings are a fraction of the predicted
"upto" [24.1 Mb/s down and 5.6Mb/s
up](http://s.natalian.org/2013-04-14/1365979405_1366x768.png) speeds.

Our internet speed just about doubled, however so did our **costs**. Ignoring the BT line rental tax of ~150GBP:

* [Home::1 Internet Access](http://www.aa.net.uk/broadband-home1.html) is now 25GBP
* Home::1 Add-On: <abbr title="Fibre to the Cabinet">FTTC</abbr> line, for having Superfast Internet costs **10GBP extra a month**

Putting our Internet cost at 35GBP a month. This is about twice the cost of ADSL when you factor in the 100GBP installation cost.

Looking around, the monopoly BT offers [BT infinity for 15GBP](http://www.productsandservices.bt.com/products/broadband/packages) a month, but:

* I do not want to support the BT monopoly
* BT are probably getting a special price from BT Openreach
* BT product is subsidised by the fact that they usually manage to sell you loads of other crap too
* Dynamic IP / no IPv6, so BT's product is useless if you want to have a home cloud server

To add to my woes our new <abbr title="Fibre to the Cabinet">FTTC</abbr> connection seems unstable at times. We've called out BT
several times via AAISP who just run a line check and leave. They make no effort to deal
with the instability or slow speeds. One engineer speculated that the copper
wires running from the cabinet are probably in bad shape, however BT will not
work on them.

# Conclusion

I've spoken to directly with <http://www.cornwalldevelopmentcompany.co.uk/> and
they say "Having looked at your location this is the sort of speed that I would
expect over that distance of copper." I can't help but think this technology is
inappropriate for rural settings since you can't expect people to live close to
a cabinet! If you are lucky enough to live very close to a cabinet, you are
probably laughing, otherwise this **technology is not fit for purpose**.

I intend on complaining and participating in [broadband
studies](http://s.natalian.org/2013-09-28/1380371434_1366x768.png) until
something is earnestly done about [broadband in
Britain](http://webconverger.org/blog/entry/UK_Internet/). There are still many
villages without mobile service, let alone broadband. Considering the costs
to consumers, together with 100s of millions of European funding support to aid
the BT monopoly, it's a [scandal and I'm not the only one to think
so](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24227096).
