Wait, you are probably looking at that Speedtest and salivating?

That Speedtest is only testing the [OpenNET](http://www.opennet.com.sg/) local to Singapore.

What about Malaysia?

These were taken on a Friday evening on the **best** M1 Fibre product you can
buy, here in Singapore.  Business line. Fiber BizPac 100M for almost 300SGD a
month or ~220USD.

# European transits go across North America

Basically if you dealing with Europe, you are at the end of the World. There is
routing west of Singapore. Lines typically go upto Hong Kong, then Tokyo, then
across North America. If you get better than 5Mbps to London you are doing VERY
well.

# Contract lengths are usually 24 months

Want a fast connection for just 6 months? Sorry, you're screwed.

# All paths lead to OpenNET/Singtel

If though there is a couple of ISPs in Singapore, they all end up on the same
OpenNET/Singtel infrastructure I'm told. There is effectively no competition or
innovation.

# No customer service

Want to complain to someone sane about Packet Loss? Fat chance. No ISP in
Singapore is on Twitter either and you've got to ask yourself why.
