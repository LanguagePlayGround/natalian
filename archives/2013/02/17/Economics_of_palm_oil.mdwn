Palm Oil from the Palm tree is a popular crop in Malaysia and Indonesia. One in
which they are clearing thousands of square kilometers of natural vegetation
for, **increasingly** year after year. Palm Oil is used in cosmetics and is
especially good in cooking, as it is allegedly healthier and has a high smoking
point.  It's also used as biofuel to replace fossil fuels. There is strong
steady demand for Palm Oil worldwide.

Here are some figures to dwell upon, that I sourced through a contact in the Industry.

1 Hectacre for planting Palm Oil can be bought for as little as 1000RM.

150 Palm Oil trees can be planted on 1 Hectacre.

It takes 3 years for a Palm Oil tree to start producing its crop.

Each tree can produce more than a metric ton a year.

Each metric ton is worth about 2500RM in markets today, meaning that a single Palm tree makes about 3000RM a year.

So for each hectacre, with 150 trees producing upon it, you can be generate 3000*150=450000RM a year, that's about 90000GBP.
