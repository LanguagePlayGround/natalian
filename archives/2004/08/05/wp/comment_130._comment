<p>OK. I apt-got mysql from unstable (along with dependencies) and then wordpress install went fine. Thanks for making this package!.</p>

<p>Some questions:</p>

<p>- Can&#8217;t you have the package automatically run the install.php<br />
    script in order to create the wordpress tables?</p>

<p>- Can&#8217;t you have the package automatically update the apache<br />
    config file so that Apache knows about the symlink to<br />
    /usr/share/wordpress?</p>

<p>- The wordpress database and tables are not deleted from the<br />
    MySQL after apt-get remove. Seems like they should be.</p>

<p>- apt-get remove leaves the /usr/share/wordpress/wp-config.php<br />
    file and everyhing in /etc/wordpress behind. Why?</p>
