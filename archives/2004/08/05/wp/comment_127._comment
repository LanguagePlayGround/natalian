<p>Any instruction to install?  I&#8217;ve try using dpkg -i wordpres&#8230;..deb and i got an error: <br />
<span class="caps">ERROR</span> 1044 at line 1: Access denied for user: &#8216;debian-sys-maint@localhost&#8217; to database &#8216;wordpress&#8217;<br />
So i&#8217;m suppose to have &#8220;wordpress&#8221; db created huh&#8230;</p>

<p>Anyway to do step by step config? or is that basically the other way to install it?</p>
