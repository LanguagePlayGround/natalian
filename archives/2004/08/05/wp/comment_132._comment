<p>OK. Your package is definitely better than the current one that&#8217;s in unstable. (That one doesn&#8217;t do any MySQL setup at all, or even<br />
automatically create a wp-config.php file. Might as well just install<br />
from the WP tarball itself rather than using that package.)</p>

<p>But would definitely be better if you could have your package<br />
automatically set up the tables and Apache config file. And also<br />
if it did a clean remove of everything.</p>
