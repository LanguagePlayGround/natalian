<p><span class="caps">SSH</span>-ing from remote machine to remote machine is considered a security risk.<br />
Could someone write a script please to detect this please?</p>

<p>Argh, I hate passwords and I have been thinking of setting up a DB with an <span class="caps">XMLRPC</span> interface where people can just fill it up with password records. From old BBSes. From craptastic Web forums. One could conduct &#8220;research&#8221; on passwords, just lookup a user&#8217;s password or look for a pattern.</p>

<p>Have you ever mis-typed your password? And then tried all your &#8220;other&#8221; passwords to gain access to a service, but see them all fail? Then try the initial password again and gain access?<br />
What happens if someone logged all your attempts.</p>
