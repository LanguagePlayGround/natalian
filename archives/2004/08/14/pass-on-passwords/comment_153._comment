<p>Ah, I misunderstood then. Well, agent forwarding is at least a way to get rid of private keys and password prompts for ssh sessions which inititiate on remote machines, I guess. Kerberos ticket forwarding (through ssh) could get rid of some more password prompts for services which you admin, although use of Kerberos is not always possible.</p>
