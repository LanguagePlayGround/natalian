<p>Just boot off the knoppix disc and apt-get install subversion. You might need to tweak the sources.list to a debian source.</p>

<p>subversion will then be loaded into ram and you can go about your business. You&#8217;ll just need to reinstall it every time you reboot. Works great for those packages that are in debian and not in knoppix.</p>
