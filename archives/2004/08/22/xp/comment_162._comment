<p>Hmmm, I don&#8217;t have a test machine with XP on it.</p>

<p>I had a look at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=98788">Colinux</a>. The distribution does not make sense. A 2meg .exe. What about the rest? RootFS is all I need Why don&#8217;t they just have an .ISO for me to burn?? :/</p>
