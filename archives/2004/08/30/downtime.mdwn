<p>End of an era. I am moving out of Finland tomorrow for good.</p>

<p>However I won&#8217;t be taking my server. As I can&#8217;t afford to pay the hosting costs of <a href="http://pannuhuone.org/">pannuhuone.org</a> while travelling, I am co-locating on a friend&#8217;s <span class="caps">DSL</span> connection.</p>

<p>So the machine where this blog is hosted and some other stuff will be down for not more than a day. Fingers crossed.</p>
