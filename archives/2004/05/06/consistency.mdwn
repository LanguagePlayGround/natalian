<p>Did you support the War on Afghanistan?</p>

<p>Did you support the War on Iraq?</p>

<p>If you answered yes or no in <strong>both</strong> questions, you&#8217;re consistant. If not, I will rip you to shreds.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s amazes me how many people out there answer &#8220;yes&#8221; to the first, but &#8220;no&#8221; to the second. The justification for War in both cases are the same. To solve humanitarian problems and give freedom, stop torture, return rule of law and so on.</p>
