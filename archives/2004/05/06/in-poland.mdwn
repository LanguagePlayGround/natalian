<p>What&#8217;s good:</p>

<ul>
<li>Food</li>
<li>Krakow</li>
<li>Surprisingly Warsaw, with it&#8217;s Palace on water</li>
<li>Jewish quarter/history in Krakow is interesting</li>
<li>Flowers everywhere</li>
<li>Average breast size being larger compared to Finland</li>
<li>Salt mine near Krakow</li>
<li>London style crusty bogies&#8230;</li>
</ul>

<p>What&#8217;s not so good:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="caps">UHT</span> milk is the norm, whilst I&#8217;m accustomed to fresh milk(1%)</li>
<li>Beer gives me a hangover </li>
<li>Spelling in Poland is abysmal</li>
<li>Lots of private security firms is not encouraging</li>
<li>Marketing and advertisements are brash</li>
<li>Neither roads or pavements are EU standard imho</li>
<li>Everytime I used my credit card they printed the full CC no. on all receipts. <span class="caps">DUMB</span>.</li>
<li>Mall culture in Warsaw</li>
</ul>

<p>Another thing that surprised me in Poland, is that there are no black people to be seen. I wonder how that will change. Isn&#8217;t Fashion TV just <span class="caps">WEIRD</span>? Check out my <a href="http://pictures.natalian.org/fujipol/">Polish pictures</a>. Couldn&#8217;t embed them in here as a couple of interesting ones have corrupted <span class="caps">EXIF</span> headers, and hence their time is screwed up.</p>
