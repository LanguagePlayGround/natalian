That's quite a serious one.                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
:-). Well, you can have a look at the relevant writings but the basic                                                                                                                                                                   
idea is:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
SGML: _complex_, described in a 400 page ISO standard, _does_ include so                                                                                                                                                                
called exclusions and inclusions so that you can say:                                                                                                                                                                                   
        b: all inline                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
        a: all inline _excluding a_                                                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
XML: _simple_, described in 40 pages. Much simpler content models.                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
The good thing: XML is _a lot_ easier to write software for.                                                                                                                                                                            
The bad thing: since XML is upwards compatible with SGML they couldn't

Well, with almost any kind of grammar you have restrictions that you                                                                                                                                                                    
cannot check on the grammar level. Think C: a syntactically correct                                                                                                                                                                     
program might still not _link_. These have to be checked in some other                                                                                                                                                                  
way - you just have to be aware of what these are. Validity just means                                                                                                                                                                  
that you don't have to check the stuff that _can_ be expressed in the                                                                                                                                                                   
DTD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
So my point was really: XHTML doesn't remove the possibility for                                                                                                                                                                        
ambiguity in the document structure and doesn't remove the need to make                                                                                                                                                                 
judgements on the application level. But I agree with you that there is                                                                                                                                                                 
a big difference between the kinds of HTML docs normally on the web and                                                                                                                                                                 
with the strictness of XHTML. What I _don't know_ is how significant                                                                                                                                                                    
this difference is.
