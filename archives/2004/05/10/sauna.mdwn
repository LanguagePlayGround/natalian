<p>There are two things I feel that people get wrong with Saunas:</p>

<ul>
<li>time</li>
<li>temperature</li>
</ul>

<p>You do not have to count down 15 minutes in the sauna whilst watching a sand clock.<br />
You go in and leave the sauna when <strong>you feel</strong> like doing so. I have a <strong>personal</strong> routine of going about 5, 10, 5 minutes with a couple of minutes break between with warm showers. You generally have to wait at least ten minutes after the last turn to prevent &#8220;sauna sweats&#8221; when you have all your clothes back on and resume your normal activities.</p>

<p>On regards to temperature. It does not have to be like 100 degrees! Most saunas I goto are around 80 degrees celcius after steaming up the place a fair bit with warm water on the hot stones.</p>
