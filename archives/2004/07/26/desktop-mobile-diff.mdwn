<p>I cooked up a <a href="http://cookie.dabase.com/">cookie test</a> to see if my mobile is accepting cookies.</p>

<p>It seems to. Although there is no telling how much this Nokia UA can eat&#8230;</p>

<p>I also <a href="http://cookie.dabase.com/logs/">logged</a> and <a href="http://cookie.dabase.com/logs/mozVSnokiaUA.diff">diffed the <strong>os.environ</strong> between my Mozilla and UA.</a></p>

<p>Interesting&#8230;</p>
