<p>As far as you are concerned, <span class="caps">WML</span> 2.0 does not exist and has never existed. We only mention it here for background information.</p>

<p><span class="caps">WML</span> 2.0 was an attempt at merging <span class="caps">WML</span> and <span class="caps">XHTML</span> Basic before the <span class="caps">WAP</span> 2.0 spec was finalized. It was eventually discarded. Telephone manufacturers can support it silently inside their browsers as a possible way to transition to <span class="caps">XHTML</span> MP through automatic translation, but the <span class="caps">WAP</span> Forum clearly states that such a mark-up is not meant for developers. If you come across the term, be aware that <span class="caps">WML</span> 2.0 is not something you as a developer need to care about.</p>
