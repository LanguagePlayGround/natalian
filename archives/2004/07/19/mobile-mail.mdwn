<p>My sister in Japan is using <a href="http://www.vodafone.jp/scripts/english/top.jsp">Vodafone</a> that features <strong><span class="caps">EMAIL</span></strong> instead of text messages.</p>

<p>I have been using it for more than a month and it works! I have never been in such good contact with my sister.</p>

<p>She can attach little pictures of what she&#8217;s upto to the email she sends too. Great. No stupid <span class="caps">MMS</span> follow this link shit&#8230;</p>
