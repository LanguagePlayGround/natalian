<p>Must look into that, thank you.</p>

<p>But I think there is problem. I usually read my mail from a remote machine, and not on the server ! Suggestions?? Ok, I guess I could at least mv the spam to the<br />
a special spam folder and perhaps run a script over it?</p>

<p>I am reducing required_hits to 0.5, and btw I had to restart spamassasin.</p>
