<p>They seem to elude bogofilter (at school) and spamassasin (on my server). I guess they are designed to mess up wordlists.</p>

<p>Considering the amount of &#8220;stop spam&#8221; posts on Debian devel, and the demand to get rid of spam, shouldn&#8217;t there be a policy, workgroup or mailing list for dealing with this particular problem? <strong>I don&#8217;t know where to go</strong> for debian-specific information to resolve this. After all there is debian-firewall and debian-isp mailing lists. Perhaps a list debian-mail for mail specific issues.</p>
