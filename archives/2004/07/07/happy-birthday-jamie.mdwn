<p>It&#8217;s <a href="http://www.kitten-x.com/">Jamie Kitson</a>&#8216;s birthday (was on 2.7)!! I don&#8217;t link his page in my &#8220;friends&#8221; section because he does not have a blog and he uses some javascript that almost crashes mozilla!</p>

<p>He has been fantastic company on a <a href="http://www.kitten-x.com/pics/europe/">European trip</a> a couple of years back. I wish he would leave his job, London apartment and girlfriend and join me in October for a little one year trip I am planning in Asia.</p>
