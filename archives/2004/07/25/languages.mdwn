<p>In Finland there are three languages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Finnish</li>
<li>Swedish</li>
<li>English</li>
</ul>

<p>Often I am faced with choosing a language when using a Web application.</p>

<p><strong>But why?</strong> I have my <a href="http://pictures.natalian.org/screenies/2004/jul/25/11:26:03/">languages dialog correctly setup in my browser.</a></p>

<p>I know <a href="http://www.debian.org/intro/cn">Debian does this</a> , but why doesn&#8217;t anyone else do this?</p>

<p>Is it hard to do? Is there no support in web application languages?</p>

<p><a href="https://oodi-www.it.helsinki.fi/hy/">Weboodi</a> is a web application for registering at my <a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/">University.</a></p>

<p>There I have to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Choose English at log in screen.</li>
<li>Log in and it is back in Finnish&#8230; <strong>sigh</strong></li>
<li>Find settings. <span class="caps">WTF</span> are they called in Finnish. (Find dictionary or just randomly hit stuff)</li>
<li>Choose English as my language in another language and save&#8230;</li>
<li>Log out and re-open the application. Guess what language? Finnish again&#8230;</li>
</ol>

<p>Additional thought: If user does not have their language dialog setup correctly(like no languages set), perhaps the web application can invoke the dialog of the UA.</p>
