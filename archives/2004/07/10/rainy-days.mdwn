<p><a href="http://www.fmi.fi/weather/local.html?kunta=Helsinki">Helsinki&#8217;s weather</a> sucks so bad.                                                                                        <br />
                                                                                                                                                                              <br />
Argh, let me rant about:                                                                                                                                                      <br />
                                                                                                                                                                              <br />

# Helsinki University                                                                                                                                                         <br />

<p><a href="http://natalian.org/archives/2004/06/21/dna-gprs/"><span class="caps">DNA</span> <span class="caps">GPRS</span> service is so fallible</a> and a recent communication from them titled &#8220;Special Conditions for <span class="caps">DNA</span>&#8216;S <span class="caps">GPRS</span> data services&#8221; is so painfully daft. I have to goto a special address and make sure my settings are correct. You <span class="caps">DNA</span> sent me the fucking settings. Then it wants me to check the model of my mobile. Oh ffs.  No. You sold me the phone. Then there is a paragraph about the usage fee for the calender month (I think) and if I exceed the quota. How the hell am I supposed to know what my quota is? Oh, I can send <span class="caps">SALDO</span> E via text message for 8 cents a message. Oh great, why not via <span class="caps">GPRS</span>?</p>

<p>Helsinki University and their Internet policy is just anti-social. For example if I bring my laptop over to fellow student&#8217;s place to play, its so not easy to connect. <a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/hendry/content/hoasnet/">Sonera&#8217;s <span class="caps">HOASNET</span></a> connections require PPPoe, and a username and password. <span class="caps">WTF</span> is the point. No one remembers their username and password, and PPPoe is an absolute bitch to setup. If they don&#8217;t have a Sonera connection, they might have a real university connection, and then people aren&#8217;t allowed to share the connection. No open wireless nodes. Copying across a mac address is painstaking. Open the node. Lets have social computing, and remove all these stupid frustrating obstacles.</p>

<p>Third <a href="http://fi.fujitsu.com/english/automatia/">Otto&#8217;s ATMs.</a> I thought I was going mad for weeks. It asks me to press OK after entering my <span class="caps">PIN</span> now. <span class="caps">WTF</span>? Now I have to press an extra button for no reason.  I was thinking if you were every going to change it, why not improve it? Every single time I use that machine, I usually draw 20 <span class="caps">EUR</span>. Why doesn&#8217;t the program do a shortcut to it?  Now I enter my cash card, type pin, hit ok, select my account, select 20 eur, wait, say no thank you to a slip, take card, take cash. It should be just be enter card, enter pin, hit 20 eur, take card and take cash. Fujitsu fools.</p>
