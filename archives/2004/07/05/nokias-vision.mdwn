<p>Who was the &#8220;wrong person&#8221; mentioned in the <a href="http://www.littlespringsdesign.com/design/xhtmlinfo.html">politics</a> bit btw? ;)</p>

<p>Nokia has always had a vision that the internet on phones should be <br />
exactly like the internet on the computer.  Openwave (Phone.com/Unwired<br />
Planet) had the vision that the phone-based internet should be different,<br />
with different features.  Unfortunately some Openwave standards-only (no<br />
real notion of user experience) said that it was okay for that stuff to<br />
be optional&#8230; and of course this is what Nokia really wanted to hear.<br />
By the time that the usability and developer folks got back into the<br />
discussion, the decision was final &#8211; thus spelling the end of &#8220;WML 2&#8221;.<br />
It&#8217;s now just <span class="caps">XHTML</span> Basic/MP delivered via <span class="caps">WAP</span>.  With push messaging and<br />
other <span class="caps">WAP</span> stuff.</p>
