<p><a href="http://natalian.org/archives/2004/05/25/consensus/">Lets continue from my earlier post.</a></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/oss/consensus/index.html">Consensus project</a> is a <a href="http://www.consensus-online.org/eu01.html">European funded</a> <a href="http://www.consensus-online.org/partners01.html">consortium of companies</a> which produces the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/07/DIAT/posn/nokia-ibm-sap.html">Rendering Independent Markup Language</a> (RIML) specification and prototype implementation. The project aim was to enable access to Web content through run-time adaptation primarily for mobile devices. To clarify, <strong><span class="caps">RIML</span> is not adaption</strong> as it does not adapt Web content, it compiles its own <span class="caps">RIML</span> language.<br />
Their approach like other <strong>device dependent techniques</strong> was to compile a list of devices and their immature UA features in order to output device dependent content to.</p>

<p><span class="caps">RIML</span> is based on W3C technologies <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml2/"><span class="caps">XHTML</span> 2.0,</a> <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/">XForms</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-smil/"><span class="caps">SMIL</span></a> and extensions. All these technologies are unlikely to be implemented on the Web.  <span class="caps">XHTML</span> 2.0 for example is backwards <strong>incompatible</strong> with <span class="caps">HTML</span> or <span class="caps">XHTML</span> 1.0. XForms is a very large specification which <a href="http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1085056751&amp;count=1">critics say has so many dependencies (e.g.  XPath) and reuses so few of the technologies already implemented (e.g. JavaScript, <span class="caps">HTML</span>) that it couldn&#8217;t fit an into a browser while still being able to browse the Web.</a> <span class="caps">RIML</span> extensions include pagination, layout and navigation in the language. It also supports UA Profiles. The <span class="caps">XML</span> based language uses <span class="caps">XSLT</span> to transform the <span class="caps">RIML</span> markup broken up into device classes to generate particular content such as <span class="caps">WML</span> or <span class="caps">XHTML</span>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.consensus-online.org/">Consensus project</a> claims to provide an implementation of a <a href="http://www.consensus-online.org/announcement.html">reverse proxy prototype</a> that supported the use of <span class="caps">RIML</span> with no installation required on the client side. The prototype has an increbible <a href="http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/oss/consensus/installation.html">amount of dependencies of resource hungry tools,</a> that this would be a good idea.</p>

<p>Despite <span class="caps">RIML</span>&#8216;s strong support and funding, it is a another example of a heavyweight language for generating device dependent code that is so complex that it is impractical. The project has been <a href="http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/oss/cvs/consensus/">inactive for several months,</a> despite the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-di/2004Jun/0019.html">code being open sourced to attract developers.</a>  <span class="caps">RIML</span> is a sad testament to the unworkable <a href="http://w3.org/">W3C</a> family of <span class="caps">XML</span> technologies in the last 5 years and their rejection of the language of the Web, <span class="caps">HTML</span>.</p>
