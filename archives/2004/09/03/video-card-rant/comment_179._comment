<p>well i have a nforce2 ultra. every part inculded in there is lovely (lan, sound, firewire, usb), no problems what so ever. i guess your uncle doesn&#8217;t play doom3, then you could go for the model with integrated video (geforce2 i think)</p>

<p>in the other hand i have had many problems with via chips in the past.</p>
