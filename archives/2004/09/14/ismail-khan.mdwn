<p>I experienced quite a surreal moment last night watching <span class="caps">BBC</span> News 24 early in the morning.</p>

<p>They ran a story about <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=uk&amp;q=Ismail+Khan&amp;ie=UTF-8">Ismail Kahn</a> and his name seemed familiar.</p>

<p>I am finishing off a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0586087060/qid%3D1047815377/sr%3D1-2/ref%3Dsr%5F1%5F2%5F2/026-6662018-1106053">book published in 1988 about Nick Danziger&#8217;s Travels</a> and in the book he talks about this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhajadeen">Muhajadeen</a> captain who offers the author kindness and protection to a particularly precarious journey across Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Same guy, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/2535261.stm">Ismail Khan.</a></p>
