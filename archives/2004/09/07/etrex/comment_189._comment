<p>That picture is way cool. Garmin has some really nice tools and maps from all over the world; pity that as soon as you walk into Nuuksio or any other place without car roads, the maps don&#8217;t help you. Still, the position memory is a very helpful tool for finding your way home, say, after a night in the pub ;)</p>
