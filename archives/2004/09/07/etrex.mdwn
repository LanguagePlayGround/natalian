<p>I bought a <a href="http://www.garmin.com/products/etrex/">Etrex</a> with a serial cable for 100 <span class="caps">UKP</span> and today it arrived.</p>

<p>Wow!</p>

<p>I have not been so enthralled by a gadget for years.</p>

<p>It tells the time. It can figure out north if you are moving. It tells you exactly where you are within say 10m. You can put down way points. It draws a map of your movements. It can estimate when you will reach a destination by calculating the average speed. It is completely cool!</p>

<p>The two downsides I have seen so far as the batteries will not last more than a day. Also it needs to have a clear view of the sky for it to work. I wish it was smaller too. I have also found it a problem to read co-ordinates off a ordnance map accurately. Perhaps I will get better at this. I should find out how to download maps onto my computer.</p>

<p>Another aspect to running around with this device is <a href="http://www.geocaching.com">Geocaching.</a></p>

<p>People hide a log book somewhere for you to find at particular co-ordinates. I&#8217;ll try find one tomorrow near where I live in <a href="http://prazefarm.co.uk/">Cornwall.</a></p>
