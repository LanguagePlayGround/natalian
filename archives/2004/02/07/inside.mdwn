<p>My camera seems to do odd effects under certain conditions. This morning I raided Hakaniemi for some fresh goods. I plan to cook that bony Lahna fish with some onions and some fresh coriander in the oven.</p>

<p>This weekend I have <a href="http://www.ken-guru.net/">DJ Ken-Guru aka Jari from Oulu</a> staying over. Last night he and his girlfriend went out to see Kraftwerk.  I didn&#8217;t have a ticket, therefore I didn&#8217;t go. I fell asleep at about 9pm last Friday(I was suffering from a hang over from Thursday, OK?). He did say how crowded Helsinki was after the gig and there were massive queues at clubs everywhere.  Yeah, Helsinki can be like that. I really can&#8217;t recommend any public party place in Helsinki. Plenty of degenerate drinking holes mind&#8230;</p>

<p>Oh yeah. I swore to myself this a technical blog! Here are some <a href="debian/">debian packages</a> I am working on.</p>

<p>I wish I was in <a href="http://www.prazefarm.co.uk/enquiry/">Cornwall</a> celebrating my Dad&#8217;s birthday today. I am proposing a few toasts via a bottle of South African Red Roodeberg today then.</p>
