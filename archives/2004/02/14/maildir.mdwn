<p>I spent most of my day pouring over exim4, mutt, dovecot, maildrop/mailfilter, bogofilter and spamassasin documentation and examples. And when that failed, I was just experimenting.</p>

<p>I must have quite a polished setup now, including offlineimap for when I without a net connection (and backups), mairix for searching my mail and rss2email for news feeds.</p>

<p>What cost me a lot of time today, is maildir. Note you have to have this stupid dot prefix to the filename. So your spam folder should be called, <strong>.spam</strong>. I wish there was stronger conventions when it came to naming of the folders. I don&#8217;t like for example <em><span class="caps">INBOX</span>.lists.debian-www</em>. Having slashes would of been much nicer. And everything lowercase.</p>

<p><span class="caps">TODO</span>:</p>

<p>Get bogofilter to periodically train from a junk folder I create. <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6439">I can&#8217;t pipe directly into bogofilter</a>, as I generally do not read mail on my mail server!</p>

<p>Cleverly combine or rsync mails from my school Courier&#8217;s <span class="caps">IMAP</span> and my Dovecot <span class="caps">IMAP</span>.</p>

<p>I will love to share my configuration with you from my <a href="http://svn.natalian.org/">repo</a>, but it&#8217;s web interface is a little unstable.</p>
