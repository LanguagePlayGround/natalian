<p>Unfortunately it is not possible for South African citizens living abroad to<br />
register for voting in terms of the new Electoral Act passed towards the end of<br />
last year. And also, its not possible to register for voting without +Barcoded<br />
ID <span class="caps">BOOK</span> with you. Thank you.</p>

<p>As you may or may not know there are many South African citizens living abroad since the fall of the economy and the perilous crime waves to sweep the country.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been ten years of freedom. Ten years of ignorance to <span class="caps">AIDS</span> directly affecting more than a fifth of the nation. Ten years of corruption and scandal. Ten years of absolute power from the <a href="http://www.anc.org.za/"><span class="caps">ANC</span></a>.</p>

<p>So as a South African citizen living abroad, <a href="http://www.elections.org.za/">I can&#8217;t vote</a> for change thanks to recent changes to the Electoral Act. Another success of the <span class="caps">ANC</span> to ensure freedom to stay in power.</p>
