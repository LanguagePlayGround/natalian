<p>I have relieved with the aforementioned problems by running Vim 6.2 and these lines:</p>

<p>set encoding=utf-8          &#8221; Set Unicode as the default encoding                                                                                                                                                  <br />
set fileencodings=ucs-bom,utf-8,latin1</p>
