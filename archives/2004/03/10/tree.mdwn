<p>While walking home drunk from satumaa karaoke bar the night before last, I noticed the tree there by Kamppi has been cut down. It looks like it has been dead for awhile, but it&#8217;s very sad all the same. That tree must have been one of Helsinki&#8217;s very oldest.</p>

<p>There are not many old trees in Finland. The only other place I know which has a few is the University Botanical gardens.</p>
