<p>It works mainly the other way round. <br />
Let&#8217;s say something cost 150 euros. Well, 150 euros is a big sum, I&#8217;m not buying anything for that price unless I&#8217;m sure. <br />
So here&#8217;s the trick : Rise the price to 199 euros. Now, one is thinking &#8220;wow, it&#8217;s less than 200 euros&#8221; and even though it&#8217;s totally irrational and a complete psychological factor, people will buy more of the stuff! <br />
Tried and approved around the world!</p>
