<p>How many times how you seen this?</p>

<span style="font-size: 10em;">0</span><span style="font-size: 1em; vertical-align: 400%;">99</span>     

<p>It annoys me as it makes items look like they cost nothing at first, then you end up staring at the small double digits beside the zero trying to make out the actual price.</p>

<p>Is there a good reason for this, besides the obvious marketing ploy?</p>

<p>Yes there is. So my dad tells me. When you run a shop and you sell items for say 1 <span class="caps">EURO</span> and you go up to pay the cashier/clerk. What stops the clerk from putting the 1 <span class="caps">EURO</span> in his or her pocket? The fact that the price is 99 cents means the clerk needs to register the purchase and open the till for the 1 cent change.</p>

<p>In Finland they don&#8217;t circulate 1 or 2 cent coins so it&#8217;s 95 cents here.<br />
Bargain.</p>
