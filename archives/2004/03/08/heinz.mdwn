<p>57 varieties?</p>

<p>Today I noticed a new Organic/Luomu/Ekological variety of the famous worldwide tomato sauce brand.</p>

<p>However, still 57 varieties printed on the bottle neck.</p>

<p>And one has to ask why don&#8217;t they just make their core tomato sauce product organic, instead of milking concerned shoppers. I do not respect Heinz nearly as much as I used to.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll try some other tomato sauce product.</p>
