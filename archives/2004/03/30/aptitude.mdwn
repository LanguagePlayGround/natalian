<p>Aptitude in unstable used to work for me. Now I seem to have to press shift+u for it to start upgrading packages. Anyway, I am back to:<br />
<pre><br />
hendry@bilbo:~$ sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get -u dist-upgrade<br />
</pre></p>

<p><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>: You need to goto into the menu, Options->Misc and select &#8220;Automatically upgrade installed packages&#8221;.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t understand why that option changed, and it&#8217;s bad kudos all the same on such a fine tool :/</p>
