<p>A new pair of glasses I ordered from Estonia while <a href="http://pictures.natalian.org/2004/mar/11/">I was there with my sister</a>, arrived today. The total cost was 120 EUROs (including delivery). A friend told me he bought the cheapest pair of prescription glasses in Finland and it cost him 260 EUROs, so I have made a substantial saving.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s still a lot of money in my opinion. I lost my last pair of (more expensive) Armani glasses in a sauna, I think. Anyway, what do you dear reader think of my new look?</p>
