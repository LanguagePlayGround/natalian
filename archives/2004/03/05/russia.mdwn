<p>My Russian collegue over Friday Spaghetti Bolognese lunch was telling my about driving <strike>fines</strike>bribes in Russia. About 2USD if you break the limit by 20km/h or so. 10USD if you double the limit, for example going over 80km/h in a 40km/h zone.</p>

<p>However he is extremely worried now, as he like I, has converted his driving license to a Finnish license. Now the traffic police will look at the card and think he has money&#8230;</p>

<p>hehe</p>

<p>Another interesting fact which I am having trouble verfying, is that most traffic accidents in Finland happen with Russians involved.</p>
