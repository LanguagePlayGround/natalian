<p>I was attending my normal weekly foriegn student night at &#8220;Bar Fly&#8221; tonight, except this time they asked for ID.</p>

<p>I simply do not carry ID for numerous reasons.</p>

<p>The doorman claimed that I needed it in order to comply with Finnish law.</p>

<p>Hmmm right&#8230;</p>

<p>And today while I was going to gym, I usually try my best to walk past reception. Oh no, today they wanted me to identify myself, with further information of what time I was playing squash, where, and who with.</p>

<p>Is there a country I go about my daily activities like a free man?</p>
