<p>In newsfeeds and the like, which I suppose is most applicable in this reference, I feel bold is most useful&#8212;it catches the eye.</p>

<p>In formal documents, i.e. in academic contexts, stick with traditional values: use italics only, and not excessively. In these documents there is no need for eye-catchers.</p>

<p>All mobiles should support italics. I hate how my Siemens C55 turns any number into what looks like a hyperlink (in fact, colour negative or what do we call it) but cannot be activated in any way.</p>

<p>I do not mind browsers supporting blinking and marquees, but I want a content filter that disallows me to enter any websites written by the idiots who use it in text display 8)</p>
