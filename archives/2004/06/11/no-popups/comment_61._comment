<p>And how does the browser know the contact e-mail address of the site owner?</p>

<p>This is actually one of the most annoying things about <acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym>&#8216;s way of handling 404 pages.  If your <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language"><span class="caps">HTML</span></acronym> is reasonably efficient and you provide a useful 404 page whose size is below IE&#8217;s threshold then no IE user will see your nice 404 page (unless you pad out the file with spaces or something equally hacky).</p>
