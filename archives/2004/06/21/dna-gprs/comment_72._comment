<p>And you intend to leave Finland? Better think twice.</p>

<p>You may think your <span class="caps">DNA</span> <span class="caps">GPRS</span> service is expensive, but you&#8217;re a spoilt kid. In six days, I&#8217;m going back to the Netherlands. The Netherlands. The most densely populated country of Europe. Small surface area, many inhabitants per square kilometre. Sound like telecommunication heaven to you? It could have been so good. But I will be returning to a mobile operator that charges me per Mb for <span class="caps">GPRS</span> (though without <span class="caps">CUBIO</span>&#8216;s monthly fee), and larger data packages are ridiculously more expensive. <span class="caps">DNA</span> gives you 100Mb for 16,65, but <span class="caps">KPN</span>, one of Holland&#8217;s largest mobile operators, still charges you EUR23,80 for a crappy (brace!) <a href="http://www.kpn.com/kpn/show/id=388860/sc=d29882"><span class="caps">TEN</span> <span class="caps">MEGABYTES</span>!</a> It&#8217;s probably the most expensive operator in the Netherlands, but it is an indication of the hell I&#8217;m returning into. In fact, as in much of Europe, Dutch operators sell contracts that include the number of minutes the customer thinks he will call per month, so that it is unusual to have monthly fees below EUR15. Phones then usually come for free. Nice for gadget-fans, but I have a telephone and I want to pay little, so that I have to resort to <a href="http://www.belzaak.nl">special web-only retailers</a> who link me up with an operator whom I pay EUR25 per month plus <span class="caps">SMS</span> costs, but then after ten weeks send me EUR240 to my account (termed <b>cashback</b>). Such an indirect system! Let me keep my EUR3-per-month-EUR0,14-per-minute-EUR0,06/0,10-per-SMS <span class="caps">CUBIO</span> account please!</p>

<p>Fact is, Finland is telecommunication heaven. 16,65 per 100Mb is the best rate in the world today; and if it does not please you you&#8217;d better wait till they finally turn Helsinki into a free WiFi city like <a href="http://www.wirelessleiden.nl/">Leiden</a>. Personally, I can&#8217;t wait till the five or so WiFi hotspots in <a href="http://www.surfnet.nl/publicaties/persberichten/270504.html">my city</a> are expanded to a city-wide network. Patience, love, patience!</p>
