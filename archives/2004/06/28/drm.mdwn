<p>New to mobiles? <a href="http://www.gsmworld.com/technology/services/index.shtml">Take a look at the M-Services Phase II Evolution <span class="caps">PDF</span></a>. Lovely titbits.</p>

<p>Section 5.1 Digital Rights Management (DRM) Policy</p>

<blockquote>
Digital Rights Management is a MUST in future devices.
</blockquote>

<p>My tip for Nokia today is if you want to clamber back market share, make a phone which just works. One where I can channel content such as ringtones and images wherever I please. Otherwise you&#8217;re just going to piss me off, and when a device comes on the market which is <span class="caps">DRM</span> free I will snap it up.</p>

<p>Who is going to lose right now? All those businesses based on ringtones and little images. What a loss.</p>
