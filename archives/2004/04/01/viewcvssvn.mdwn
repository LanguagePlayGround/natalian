<a href="http://svn.natalian.org">Try my repo</a>

<p>Right now I have to :</p>

<pre>
hendry@bilbo:~$ svnadmin recover repo/
Please wait; recovering the repository may take some time...

<p>Recovery completed.<br />
The latest repos revision is 534.<br />
hendry@bilbo:~$ chmod -R 777 repo/<br />
</pre></p>

<p>Every so often. I blamed it on web crawlers, and now put in an robots exclusion directive.</p>

<p>Please work&#8230;</p>

<p>Update: Just tried it the next morning and once again it needed to be recovered. <span class="caps">WTF</span> is going on&#8230;<br />
Just tried WebSVN. Looks good, but I want to forbid access to certain private modules.</p>
