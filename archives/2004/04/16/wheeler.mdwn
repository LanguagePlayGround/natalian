<p>Last summer my <a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/masche/">flatmate&#8217;s</a> back wheel of his bike was stolen overnight at Kontula Metro. Since he left the country, I took the bike. <span class="caps">PAINSTAKINGLY</span>.</p>

<p>Last month I repaired it. It was a bit of bother getting in around let me remind you. It cost 150 <span class="caps">EUROS</span>.</p>

<p>And yesterday the <span class="caps">FRIKKIN</span>&#8217; Taiwanese frame cracked. IN <span class="caps">TWO</span> <span class="caps">PLACES</span>. Including that bit in the middle, where the pedals are attached.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a dead bike. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooOOOoooooooooooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooo</p>
