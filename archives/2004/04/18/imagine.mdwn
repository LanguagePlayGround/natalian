<p>Imagine by John Lennon is one of my favourite songs.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=lyrics+%22Imagine%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search">lyrics</a> completely agree with me. Especially on the issue of religion.</p>

<p>My jesus freak flatmate, fresh from a conference in Hungary with a fair few self help books:<br />

<p>Has absolutely shocked me with his new shirt:</p>

<p>Oh course I went on a complete verbal assault when I first saw the shirt. Now I&#8217;ve calmed down.</p>

<p>What a sick twisted selfish gimmicky stunt. That&#8217;s so ignorant. It&#8217;s atheist blasphemy. Offensive and appalling.</p>
