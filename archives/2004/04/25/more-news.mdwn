<p>I must say I am pretty addicted to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/"><span class="caps">BBC</span> News</a>. The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/mobile/">Mobile</a> version is great, it&#8217;s the only site I access with my Nokia 3100. Are there any others? A mobile <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">Guardian</a> version would be nice for another Point of View.</p>

<p>News nowdays is just so entertaining. There is just amazing stuff happening out there in the world that makes my brain boil with thoughts, trying to apply logic to it all.</p>

<p>Anyway, the other day I fealt a little in the dark that my media sources didn&#8217;t show the Falluja mob. Today, I found it on <a href="http://www.thememoryhole.org/war/fallujah_31mar04/">the Memory Hole</a>. The <a href="http://www.thememoryhole.org/memoryblog/">blog</a> is quite interesting. I find <a href="http://agonist.org/">The Agonist</a> quite a good blog for news too.</p>

<p>Ok news, this is Natalian. I am an Natalian. I am from Natal. Kwa-Zulu Natal as it&#8217;s now called. So here&#8217;s my bitter opinion on the recent South African election. <a href="http://natalian.org/archives/2004/02/26/voting-not-possible/">Remember I was disenfranchised.</a></p>

<p><span class="caps">ANC</span> has done a sterling job staying in power in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe">african democracy</a> style. Probably the best performance in whole ten years they&#8217;ve been in power. :) My reasoning is because my home state of Natal, is Zululand. Home of the Zulu &#8220;tribe&#8221;. The Zulus&#8217; political party is <a href="http://www.ifp.org.za/"><span class="caps">IFP</span></a>. The Zulu people there wouldn&#8217;t vote for the Xhosas&#8217; party, the <span class="caps">ANC</span>. Understand that. There are so many deep tribal divisions in Africa, understand that. It wouldn&#8217;t make sense that the <span class="caps">ANC</span> get more votes in Natal than the <span class="caps">IFP</span>. The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3638539.stm"><span class="caps">IFP</span> are taking the <span class="caps">ANC</span> to court over the matter.</a> The <span class="caps">IFP</span> were probably the strongest opposition party to the <span class="caps">ANC</span> in the past. Now the <a href="http://iafrica.com/news/sa/318146.htm"><span class="caps">IFP</span> are withdrawing from cabinet.</a></p>

<p>I know it&#8217;s not popular for South Africans to discuss politics. But as a South African, these last election results are depressing. People are voting along racial lines. Fiercely loyal. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/3619575.stm">They&#8217;re not thinking.</a></p>

<p>There is going to be a Freedom Day celebration(10 years!) held by the South African embassy on Monday at Hanasaari. I am going to get pissed on free South African wine to celebrate.</p>
