I am trying to write down my photo requirements, before I start madly coding.
Get stuck/bored/tired. Put it off, and find it really difficult to pick up the
pieces.

Once that is done, I plan to write some unit tests, and go from there. This should be a relatively simple program, but is it my current state of mind?  I am finding it so difficult to go about doing just about anything nowadays.

I just discovered <a href="http://www.axis-of-aevil.org/">a Helsinki
Photoblog</a>.  <a href="http://www.axis-of-aevil.org/about.html">She</a> uses
a <a href="http://www.leica-camera.com/">Leica Camera</a> which I have drooled
upon before. I do want to upgrade from my Kodak DC3400.

Although my Kodak still does take quite good snappy pictures. It&#8217;s easy
to use. Low maintenance. Robust. It&#8217;s shaped like a brick so no one would
dare steal it. Supported by gphoto2 and uses compact flash, my favourite memory
card format.

However I would like to take higher quality pictures. I generally end up taking
thousands of frankly crappy ones. I also would like a camera which  could take
pictures with GPS and with accurate time information embedded in the image
format. I would want this if I ever graduate and go travelling for a bit&#8230;
