<p>This bug has kept my thinkpad at home off the net for a couple of days.</p>

<p>I had to boot a <a href="ftp://ftp.skolelinux.no/skolelinux/knoppixes/snofrix/">Live-CD</a>. Mount my hard drive in write mode. chroot, run aptitude and install pump. <br />
<pre><br />
pump -i iface<br />
</pre><br />
Gets you back into action.</strike></p>

<p>I have been a fool. The reason why my network was not working, is that my wireless and ethernet interface swapped around. I am such a moron.</p>
