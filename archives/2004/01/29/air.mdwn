<p>Just tried out Air &#8211; Talkie Walkie from <a href="http://suprnova.org">suprnova</a> to listen to this band that seemed so popular a couple of years back, that it almost defined that space of time.</p>

<p>Listening to it again scares me. It is so empty&#8230; So rubbish !</p>

<p>Stone Roses &#8211; Fools Gold (Grooverider Mix) brings back better memories.</p>
