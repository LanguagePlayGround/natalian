UPDATE: I bought nearly 600SGD worth of [XI100DUSB-HDMI](http://www.magewell.com/hardware/dongles/xi100dusb-hdmi/xi100dusb-hdmi_features.html?lang=en) & the ATR2100-USB and here is my [first video](http://s.natalian.org/2015-04-22/supersmash.mp4) using [obs-studio](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/obs-studio/)!

I have been researching for months now, how to get a live HDMI feed in from a
camera, like my GoPro Hero 4, into my computer. [Capture comparison video](https://youtu.be/JbUl2fs097g)

# Why?

* live broadcasting e.g. <http://www.reddit.com/r/WatchPeopleCode>
* better Webcam ... I want to allow my parents to see me through a **good camera**, not the crappy 480p on the inbuilt camera in my laptop lid!!
* better sound, I should be able to mux in audio into a HDMI feed from my camera source
* optimising video editing work flows - if it is recorded, doing it live as much as possible is such a time saver

# The solutions or lack thereof

## Adobe Premiere Pro and FCPX

Initially I looked to how popular video editors expected me to import video
frames. In a very non-standard awkward manner. Often requiring special
equipment and their own proprietary drivers. I have no idea why they don't
support standards.

## Capture products

I've tried:

* <http://gamerzone.avermedia.com//game_capture/live_gamer_portable>
* <https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/sg/products/intensity>

They only work with own special drivers on MacOSX or Windows. In fact, to my
surprise the Live Gamer Portable was simple unable to stream via
<https://obsproject.com/> to <http://www.twitch.tv/> on MacOSX, but it can on
Windows. Special driver nightmare.

## The video input standards (I think)

When I plug in a video source I expect to come up on my Archlinux system as
simple as `vlc v4l2:///dev/video0`. A lot of Web cams implement this under the
moniker of [UVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_video_device_class).

So after a search for <abbr title="USB video device class">UVC</abbr> and <abbr
title='High-Definition Multimedia Interface'>HDMI</abbr> miracously I found
just two options:

* <http://www.dexteralabs.com/inogeni/> at 400USD
* Slightly dubious looking [FEBON198 USB3.0 UVC HDMI Grabber Card](http://febon.blogspot.com/2014/08/febon198-usb30-uvc-hdmi-grabber-card.html>) at 150USD
* Update: [Magewell XI100DUSB-HDMI](http://www.magewell.com/hardware/dongles/xi100dusb-hdmi/xi100dusb-hdmi_features.html?lang=en) as listed upon this [UVC](http://www.ideasonboard.org/uvc/) page with a [couple of](https://youtu.be/s6V_oyWRTLY) [promising review](http://www.amazon.com/review/R31KFJ54WHGHCI/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I16VQOY) of several
* Update: A [StarTech.com USB2 device](http://www.amazon.de/StarTech-com-USB-Gaming-Video-Aufzeichnungsger%C3%A4t/dp/B00DVS8TL0/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1426273671&sr=8-2-fkmr1&keywords=UVC+HDMI+grabber#productDetails) pointed out to me by a German no less. Has he tried it? No.

The **INOGENI 4K2USB3 4K HDMI to USB 3.0 Converter** looks perfect. It's just that it is quite expensive.

The **FEBON198** guy from Taiwan seems to think it won't work in Linux, do
interlaced input and of course offers no refund. However since I'm in
Singapore, I doubt I realistically get a refund from
[B&H](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1073122-REG/inogeni_4k2usb3_4k_hdmi_to_usb.html).

# Conclusion

After months of research... seriously, there seems just to be one standard
driver-less solution, the [Inogeni](http://www.dexteralabs.com/inogeni/), which
should work seamlessly with FFMPEG and other opensource tools on my
[[archives/2015/02/18/Archlinux_on_a_Lenovo_X1C3]]. It's great that there is
such a product, but I'm almost mystified why there is just one product that
does this, and cameras like Canon do not implement UVC.

Is there something glaringly wrong with <abbr title="USB video device
class">UVC</abbr> that I don't know about?
