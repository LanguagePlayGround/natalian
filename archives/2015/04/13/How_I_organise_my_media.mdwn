Following up from [How I organise my
pictures](archives/2013/05/09/How_I_organise_my_pictures), there has been some
changes:

* I don't like running the proprietary blob of the Dropbox client, not btsync
* static.natalian.org is now on [AWS S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

So this is the current workflow (or plan since I haven't got in the rhythm yet):

From my laptop:

1. Dump media in ~/media/{iphone6,gopro} - I use an Apple lightning cable & <a href=http://dabase.com/blog/Archiving_iPhone_images_with_Archlinux_and_ifuse/>`ifuse` for getting my iPhone media off onto Archlinux</a> - [sync-iphone.sh](http://s.natalian.org/2015-05-23/sync-phone.sh)
*  Run [datemedia.sh](http://s.natalian.org/2015-05-23/datemedia.sh) to put things in a YYYY-MM-DD organised staging area called **uploadme/**

Then I need to copy my local files to an external hard disk (/mnt/2tb/media).

[check.sh](http://s.natalian.org/2015-05-23/check.sh) does a couple of things:

* Makes sure it doesn't overwrite the destination file
* Makes sure if the destination file was deleted, it doesn't copy it back over again

## On my external disk

I first `git add .` and commit the new files. I want to keep the originals in
order to back out of any edits.

Next I run [flickr.sh](http://s.natalian.org/2015-05-23/flickr.sh) which does a couple of things:

* supplies my image viewer [sxiv](https://github.com/muennich/sxiv) with 10 images at a time to annotate (title & tag) with [.config/sxiv/exec/key-handler](http://s.natalian.org/2015-05-23/key-handler) and [image-info](http://s.natalian.org/2015-05-23/image-info).
* Prompts me to upload the image with [flickcurl](http://librdf.org/flickcurl/) in the background
* If the upload is successful, it records the photo id in $filename.uploaded. I also commit this.
