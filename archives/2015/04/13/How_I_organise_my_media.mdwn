Following up from [[archives/2013/05/09/How_I_organise_my_pictures]], there has been some changes:

* I don't like running the proprietary blob of the Dropbox client, not btsync
* static.natalian.org is now on [AWS S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

So this is the current workflow (or plan since I haven't got in the rhythm yet):

1. Dump media in ~/media/{iphone6,gopro} - I use an Apple lightning cable & <a href=http://dabase.com/blog/Archiving_iPhone_images_with_Archlinux_and_ifuse/>`ifuse` for getting my iPhone media off onto Archlinux</a> - `rsync -Part --exclude ".*/" /mnt/iphone/DCIM /home/hendry/media/iphone6`
*  Run [datemedia.sh](http://s.natalian.org/2015-05-08/datemedia.sh) to put things in a YYYY-MM-DD organised staging area called **uploadme/**
* `git annex add` my media in **uploadme/**, see [git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/)
* Run [sxiv](https://github.com/muennich/sxiv) with [~/.config/sxiv/exec/key-handler](http://s.natalian.org/2015-05-08/key-handler), using C-x C-d to [delete images](http://dabase.com/e/17006/)
* **uploadme/** media is archived to 2 external hard drives
* Using [htmlvideo](https://github.com/kaihendry/recordmydesktop2.0/blob/master/htmlvideo) to convert iphone6/*.mov to uploadme/YYYY-DD-MM/*.mp4
* Uploading photos to flickr: `flickcurl upload /tmp/foo.png title "Just a test" description "Just testing" public tags "foo, bar"`
* Uploading MP4s to S3.. since I want to resurrect <http://video.natalian.org/> sometime in the future
