So I bought some wine & beer returning from the Philippines at <abbr title="Duty Free Shop">DFS</abbr> at Changi Airport.

# Wine

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/16195511736" title="48.95SGD for Oyster Bay at Cold Storage by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7464/16195511736_b3f486446d_n.jpg" width="240" height="320" alt="48.95SGD for Oyster Bay at Cold Storage"></a>

DFS prices correspond to that on their Website
<http://www.dfs.com/en/airport-singapore/featured-brands/oyster-bay/oyster-bay-sauvignon-blanc-2011-2012-75cl-70000138048>,
that is 36.20SGD for 0.75L of Oyster Bay Sauvignon Blanc.

I checked the price with Cold Storage, which was 48.95SGD. So that's almost a
30% saving!

# Beer

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/16033890558" title="6pack Carlsberg at 16.70SGD at Cold Storage by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7471/16033890558_6035348747_n.jpg" width="320" height="240" alt="6pack Carlsberg at 16.70SGD at Cold Storage"></a>

If you don't buy spirits, you can buy 2x3 cans of beer. 2x6.30SGD of the cheapest beer there, Carlsberg is 12.60SGD. A 6 pack of Carlsberg in Cold Storage is 16.70SGD, that's a 28% difference.

# So how much is tax?

Urm, I'm not sure.
