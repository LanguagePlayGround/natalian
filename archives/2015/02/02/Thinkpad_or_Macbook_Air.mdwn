As mentioned on <http://hendry.iki.fi/about/>, my computer for last couple of
years has been a X220 and I've been using Thinkpads since 2001, erm 14 years!?

I resisted the X230 upgrade because of the inferior looking [chiclet
keyboard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiclet_keyboard) and the X240 had a
serious issue with the mouse pad, so that was a no go.

Like many, I've been hanging on <http://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad> feeling a
bit miserable. Almost accepting that my next computer would have to be a Intel
from Apple. Though the comparable models like the Macbook Air, which [I
extensively tested](http://dabase.com/blog/Macbook_Air_Early_2014_Archlinux/)
runs Archlinux... I really didn't like the keyboard and most importantly lack
of [Trackpoint](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointing_stick).

# Waited long enough

Lately I've been [developing an Android app](http://dabase.com/android). My 4GB
of RAM of my X220 is simply not enough. I need an upgrade to be productive!

Seriously.

# Generation 2015

Thankfully Lenovo reversed their earlier poor design decision and re-introduced
physical mouse buttons across their Laptop product line up, [which I have been studying](http://www.lenovo.com/psref/pdf/tabook.pdf).

Naturally I wanted to upgrade from my X220 to the X250, but on closer inspection I'm put off by the X250's:

* Glass-Fiber Reinforced Plastic
* Still the same 1366x768, 12.5"

I'm sore that Lenovo seem unable to make a Thinkpad where there aren't **huge
bezels** on the side of screen and keyboard. Shame they can't make it flush and
like the original design intention of a Bento box. :/

# X220 to ThinkPad X1 Carbon (3rd Gen) ?

The Intel Broadwell based ThinkPad X1 Carbon (3rd Gen) i5-5300U or i7-5500U looks like the one.

* Carbon X1 re-assuringly is made of Magnesium/Aluminum, and hence I'm assuming a better build quality than the X250
* The 14" sized displays starts at FHD 1920x1080, not sure I want to take the leap to WQHD 2560x1440.
* I prefer the HDMI port instead of the VGA port, since all my screens around my house are HDMI compatible, since 2010 ;)

Can't help but think a high resolution screen 2560x1440 will be an absolute
pain to setup with Xorg and likely to drain my battery faster.

My concerns with going for the X1 Carbon is that the <strike>hard drive is not
replaceable AFAICT</strike>. A [reddit user says the hard drive is a standard M2](http://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/2ug3no/thinkpad_x1_carbon_gen_3_or_wait_for_new_macbook/co8cljf) and therefore should be replacable. I inevitably want to upgrade the hard drive like I've done
on every Thinkpad I've owned. 

<strike>I'm worried that the external Ethernet is just a [poor performing USB3
to Gigabit
adaptor](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/14472901454/)</strike>. I'm
assured the [ethernet port is a real
one](http://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/2ug3no/thinkpad_x1_carbon_gen_3_or_wait_for_new_macbook/co8bivm).
I prefer to work on a wired connection.

# What next

[Apple have yet to update their Mac product
line](http://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac) to Intel's delayed Broadwell
generation. Apple might be getting better Broadwell reference hardware from
Intel than Lenovo... or have some other hardware innovation. I really like
Apple's charger cables and that would make like easier around my family since
all have Apple hardware.

Nonetheless even though I'm a ashamedly happy IOS iPhone6 user, I do want to
use the best alternative to Apple hardware and software. Got to **Think different**!

Will that be the X1 Carbon Gen 3 & Archlinux? I'll let you know. A lot will
depend on reviews and price points of the Air vs X250 vs X1 Carbon Gen 3. I can
tell you I'm not looking forward to ordering it on [Lenovo's horrible
Website](http://www.lenovo.com/sg/en/) and I won't be purchasing an extra plan
since Lenovo are absolutely hopeless at service & support.

Update: Although [Dell's Broadwell Ultrabook, the XPS 13 lacks a Trackpoint](http://hothardware.com/reviews/dell-xps-13-2015-ultrabook-hothardwares-full-review), it looks worthy of a mention. Carbon fibre and the low bezel screen looks amazing.

Update: [DoubleDown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylake_%28microarchitecture%29) pointed out that Intel's next next generation [Skylake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylake_%28microarchitecture%29) is due in a few months (Q2) since **Broadwell has been so delayed**.

Update: Despite emailing Lenovo Singapore and asking about the X1 Carbon Gen 3 and their sales guy saying they will let me know as soon as it's released... I've just noticed <http://shopap.lenovo.com/sg/en/laptops/thinkpad/x-series/x1-carbon/> for 2433SGD. GULP! More expensive that a <http://store.apple.com/sg/buy-mac/macbook-air>.

The price has shocked me a little:
* [2433SGD](http://s.natalian.org/2015-02-03/1422942103_1364x748.png) in Singapore
* [1200GBP](http://shop.lenovo.com/gb/en/laptops/thinkpad/x-series/x1-carbon/) in UK which is 2447 in SGD
* [1200USD](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/x-series/x1-carbon/) in US which works out to be 1614SGD, but it only has 4GB of RAM?!
