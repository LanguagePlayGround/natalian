# Delivery

The purchase and [delivery](https://twitter.com/kaihendry/status/567531336764628992) UX was frankly terrible. Really not forward to every [communicating with Lenovo](http://greptweet.com/u/kaihendry/#lenovo_sg), in the case there is some issue that requires customer service.

Rating: 2 of 5 stars

# Unboxing

Usual bunch of stupid pieces of paper and [ugly fingerprints](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/16556531822/)!

It's well packed though.

# Installing Archlinux

Sadly I found the [Archlinux dual boot
documentation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Windows_and_Arch_dual_boot)
a bit lacking. I was going to attempt dual boot, but I couldn't understand how
to resize the Windows NTFS partitions.  So I just gave up.

I was hoping that Lenovo would include some sort of recovery USB stick, instead
of their [weird
partitioning](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/16371358329/) they ship
with. Bye bye Windows and
[shitty](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/16531626476/) [preloaded Lenovo
software](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/16370184810/) !

I went for the "modern" [GPT
method](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Partitioning#Using_GPT_-_modern_method)
of partitioning and admittedly I have no clue what **GPT** means. I now have
just one big partition formatted with ext4:

	/dev/sda1   2048 500118158 500116111 238.5G Linux filesystem

## Mouse not working

I found <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/xf86-input-evdev-trackpoint/> to fix the physical mouse buttons.

## Odd interface names

Somewhat annoyingly my wifi0 is called `wlp4s0` and my eth0 is called
`enp0s25`. Got to thank
[systemd](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/)
for that.

## Keyboard

Different spacing to the X220. I don't like the grease marks my sweat leaves
behind. Thankfully this machine runs cool, like 42C atm, so already that's way
way more comfortable than my old Thinkpad.

I'm now also using a US keyboard layout `setxkbmap -model thinkpad -layout us -option ctrl:nocaps` from `setxkbmap -layout gb -option ctrl:nocaps`.

## Screen

Loving the 1920x1080 screen so far. Didn't have to do anything special so far
to resize anything.`google-chrome-unstable` and st's `static char font[] =
"Terminus:pixelsize=18";` is serving me well!
