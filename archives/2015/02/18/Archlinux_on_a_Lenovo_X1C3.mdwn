So I bought the [[X1 Carbon Generation 3|archives/2015/02/02/Thinkpad_or_Macbook_Air]] !

It arrived 2015-02-17 after ordering it on the 2015-02-09. It feels like bloody Christmas !!

I love how quiet this machine is.

The model number on the order is 20BTCTO1WW. Lenovo's Safety and Setup Guide refer to this as Machine Types: 20BS and 20BT. Serial number is R90F6C3B which is confirmed by `/sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_serial`.

# Delivery

The purchase and [delivery](https://twitter.com/kaihendry/status/567531336764628992) UX was frankly terrible. Really not looking forward to [communicating with Lenovo](http://greptweet.com/u/kaihendry/#lenovo_sg), in the case there is some issue that requires customer service. :/

# Unboxing

Usual bunch of stupid pieces of paper and [ugly fingerprints](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/16556531822/)!

It's well packed though. The X1C3 feels like it might not survive a drop as well as my X220. It also worryingly doesn't have spillage holes.

I am wondering about a sleeve to put it in, in order to prevent scratches and the sort whilst it travels in my pannier.

The rectangular yellow power supply connection is a bit of a disappointment.
Feels stiff, fallible and why is it so similar to have USB connector? Brain
dead. I also miss the loud BEEP when I gain or lose mains power. :/

# Installing Archlinux

Sadly I found the [Archlinux dual boot
documentation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Windows_and_Arch_dual_boot)
a bit lacking. I was going to attempt dual boot, but I couldn't understand how
to resize the Windows NTFS partitions.  So I just gave up.

Also I was put confused by the UEFI BIOS stuff. Oh well.

I was hoping that Lenovo would include some sort of recovery USB stick, instead
of their [weird
partitioning](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/16371358329/) they ship
with. Bye bye Windows and
[shitty](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/16531626476/) [preloaded Lenovo
software](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/16370184810/) ! [Confirmed by HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9072424)

I went for the "modern" [GPT
method](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Partitioning#Using_GPT_-_modern_method)
of partitioning and admittedly I have no clue what **GPT** means. I now have
just one big partition formatted with ext4:

	/dev/sda1   2048 500118158 500116111 238.5G Linux filesystem

[Syslinux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Syslinux) install was also a
little confusing. Do I run it in the `arch-chroot` or not?
`syslinux-install_update -i -a -m` worked from within the chroot, but the
default `grep root /boot/syslinux/syslinux.cfg` was `APPEND root=/dev/sda3 rw`
and not **/dev/sda1**.

## X1C3 mouse buttons not working

	# echo "options psmouse proto=imps" > /etc/modprobe.d/psmouse.conf

Thanks to: <https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=192875>

I've also [disabled the
trackpad](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/15938481073/in/photostream/)
since it was resulting in odd selections. I wonder if I can configure it **just
to scroll** ?

## Annoying network interface names

	X1C3:~$ networkctl
	IDX LINK             TYPE               OPERATIONAL SETUP
	  1 lo               loopback           carrier     configured
	  2 wlp4s0           wlan               routable    configured
	  3 enp0s25          ether              no-carrier  configuring

	3 links listed.

Somewhat annoyingly my wifi0 is called `wlp4s0` and my eth0 is called
`enp0s25`. Got to thank
[systemd](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/)
for that.

Both interfaces "just work" and perform great!

Hint if `/var/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf` is missing, you need `sudo systemctl status systemd-resolved` and then enable it.

Tethering from my iPhone6 works once `usbmuxd` is is installed, the interface name is `enp0s20u1c4i2`.

I've experienced a [wireless
issue](https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=93471), but I think it's
more a TP-LINK AP issue. Update: Frequently get thrown off the wireless
network, so I'm relying on the [ThinkPad Ethernet Expansion
Cable](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/16769857511/) heavily.

## Keyboard

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/16101234823" title="Key popped out from my new X1C3 2015 :( by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8680/16101234823_27197d5b55.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="Key popped out from my new X1C3 2015 :("></a>

Different spacing to the X220. I don't like the grease marks my sweat leaves
behind. Thankfully this machine runs cool, like 42C atm, so already that's way
way more comfortable than my old X220 Thinkpad.

I'm now also using a US keyboard layout `setxkbmap -model thinkpad -layout us
-option ctrl:nocaps` from `setxkbmap -layout gb -option ctrl:nocaps`. Need to report back how it goes...

I've discovered I need function lock on, enabled by Esc+Fn with a green light
coming on on the Fn, in order to use the function keys.

Thanks to I think [this
tip](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1497522#p1497522), when
Function is not enabled the:

* wifi kill button works
* Mute works

But not the volume or brightness buttons AFAICT. :/

I've overrided [mapping the Thinkpad keys](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/16607185822/) as above using [Xmodmap](https://github.com/kaihendry/dotfiles/blob/master/.Xmodmap) to help me find the Home/End keys better.

## Screen

I'm enjoying the 1920x1080 screen so far, especially since I more room to tile
two windows side by side in [dwm](http://dwm.suckless.org/). Didn't have to do
anything special so far to resize anything. `google-chrome-unstable` and <a
href=http://st.suckless.org/>st</a>'s `static char font[] =
"Terminus:pixelsize=18";` is serving me well!

This is [how much bigger my irssi/tmux session is now](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/16556331001/) compared to my X220!

Here you can maybe see the colour reproduction difference with a [side by side
comparison against the X220](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/16370553040).
Tbh, I'm not that happy with the way the X1C3 reproduces yellow. It's way too
close to white.

When I slouch, I notice the **viewing angles are not good**.

### Sound

Can't get sound to output on HDMI.

When I attach my iPhone headphones, the voice recordings are awful. I've even
tried my Rode SmartLav+. There is just no sweet spot on `pavucontrol` to get
noise/levels properly adjusted for a clear recording.  I suspected windows
employs some high pass filtering and that's why no one complains about the
microphone under Windows. :/

### GL performance

[ioquake-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ioquake3-git) works better than [quake3 from AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/quake3/).

	seta r_mode "-1"
	seta r_customwidth "1920"
	seta r_customheight "1080"

At least I can go full screen now. Just that my [mouse doesn't
work](https://github.com/ioquake/ioq3/issues/113). It seems to be locked to
60fps and I haven't worked out how to turn off vsync.

### USB 3 performance

I needed to backup a [nearly broken
exfat](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/exfat/upu-rfEnQ0o/hHGK5ezSu-oJ)
1TB USB3 drive to a newer USB3 2TB drive formatted in glorious ext4. Using
`sudo rsync -Part --exclude=".*" --exclude ".*/" .  /mnt/2tb/recovery/` I'm
getting 90Mb/sec across the USB3 bus.

Actually it seemed to speed up since it copied the 400+GB in 2 hrs, not the
calculated 11. Any ideas how to better calculate this?

### Other issues

I ran into this Archlinux [slow DNS resolving bug](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1387264#p1387264)
