So I bought the [[X1 Carbon Generation 3|archives/2015/02/02/Thinkpad_or_Macbook_Air]] !

It arrived 2015-02-17 after ordering it on the 2015-02-09. It feels like bloody Christmas !!

The model number on the order is 20BTCTO1WW. Lenovo's Safety and Setup Guide refer to this as Machine Types: 20BS and 20BT. Serial number is R90F6C3B which is confirmed by `/sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_serial`.

# Delivery

The purchase and [delivery](https://twitter.com/kaihendry/status/567531336764628992) UX was frankly terrible. Really not looking forward to [communicating with Lenovo](http://greptweet.com/u/kaihendry/#lenovo_sg), in the case there is some issue that requires customer service. :/

# Unboxing

Usual bunch of stupid pieces of paper and [ugly fingerprints](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/16556531822/)!

It's well packed though. The X1C3 feels like it might not survive a drop as well as my X220. It also worryingly doesn't have spillage holes.

I am wondering about a sleeve to put it in, in order to prevent scratches and the sort whilst it travels in my pannier.

The rectangular yellow power supply connection is a bit of a disappointment.
Feels stiff, fallible and why is it so similar to have USB connector? Brain
dead.

# Installing Archlinux

Sadly I found the [Archlinux dual boot
documentation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Windows_and_Arch_dual_boot)
a bit lacking. I was going to attempt dual boot, but I couldn't understand how
to resize the Windows NTFS partitions.  So I just gave up.

Also I was put confused by the UEFI BIOS stuff. Oh well.

I was hoping that Lenovo would include some sort of recovery USB stick, instead
of their [weird
partitioning](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/16371358329/) they ship
with. Bye bye Windows and
[shitty](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/16531626476/) [preloaded Lenovo
software](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/16370184810/) !

I went for the "modern" [GPT
method](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Partitioning#Using_GPT_-_modern_method)
of partitioning and admittedly I have no clue what **GPT** means. I now have
just one big partition formatted with ext4:

	/dev/sda1   2048 500118158 500116111 238.5G Linux filesystem

[Syslinux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Syslinux) install was also a
little confusing. Do I run it in the `arch-chroot` or not?
`syslinux-install_update -i -a -m` worked from within the chroot, but the
default `grep root /boot/syslinux/syslinux.cfg` was `APPEND root=/dev/sda3 rw`
and not **/dev/sda1**.

## X1C3 mouse buttons not working

	# echo "options psmouse proto=imps" > /etc/modprobe.d/psmouse.conf

Thanks to: <https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=192875>

I've also [disabled the
trackpad](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/15938481073/in/photostream/)
since it was resulting in odd selections. I wonder if I can configure it **just
to scroll** ?

## Annoying network interface names

	X1C3:~$ networkctl
	IDX LINK             TYPE               OPERATIONAL SETUP
	  1 lo               loopback           carrier     configured
	  2 wlp4s0           wlan               routable    configured
	  3 enp0s25          ether              no-carrier  configuring

	3 links listed.


Somewhat annoyingly my wifi0 is called `wlp4s0` and my eth0 is called
`enp0s25`. Got to thank
[systemd](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/)
for that.

Both interfaces "just work" and perform great!

Hint if `/var/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf` is missing, you need `sudo systemctl status systemd-resolved` and then enable it.

## Keyboard

Different spacing to the X220. I don't like the grease marks my sweat leaves
behind. Thankfully this machine runs cool, like 42C atm, so already that's way
way more comfortable than my old Thinkpad.

I'm now also using a US keyboard layout `setxkbmap -model thinkpad -layout us
-option ctrl:nocaps` from `setxkbmap -layout gb -option ctrl:nocaps`. Need to report back how it goes...

shift+ctrl+end in Chrome is a bit awkward... that's the only keystroke I know
to select to the end of a textarea. The issue is that **End** is an unintuitive
spot along the top right row.

I've discovered I need function lock on, enabled by Esc+Fn with a green light
coming on on the Fn, in order to use the function keys.

Thanks to I think [this
tip](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1497522#p1497522), when
Function is not enabled the:

* wifi kill button works
* Mute works

But not the volume or brightness buttons AFAICT.

## Screen

Loving the 1920x1080 screen so far. Didn't have to do anything special so far
to resize anything. `google-chrome-unstable` and <a href=http://st.suckless.org/>st</a>'s `static char font[] =
"Terminus:pixelsize=18";` is serving me well!

This is [how much bigger my irssi/tmux session is now](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/16556331001/) compared to my X220!

I dare say the colours are better [side by side against the X220](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/16370553040).

However when I slouch, I noticed the **viewing angle is not very good**. Maybe this will force me to sit upright!

### GL performance

[ioquake-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ioquake3-git) works better than [quake3 from AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/quake3/).

	seta r_mode "-1"
	seta r_customwidth "1920"
	seta r_customheight "1080"

At least I can go full screen now. Just that my mouse doesn't work.

## USB 3 performance

I actually need to backup a [nearly broken
exfat](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/exfat/upu-rfEnQ0o/hHGK5ezSu-oJ)
1TB USB3 drive to a newer USB3 2TB drive formatted in glorious ext4. Using
`sudo rsync -Part --exclude=".*" --exclude ".*/" .  /mnt/2tb/recovery/` I'm
getting 90Mb/sec across the USB3 bus.

Actually it seemed to speed up since it copied the 400+GB in 2 hrs, not the
calculated 11. Any ideas how to better calculate this?
