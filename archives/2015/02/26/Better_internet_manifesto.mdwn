Recently I feel inspired by [Internet's Own
Boy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3268458/) and
[Citizenfour](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4044364), enough to pen my thoughts
on how I view and judge Internet services. Much like Aaron Swartz did when he
shared his thoughts on [Open
Access](https://archive.org/stream/GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto/Goamjuly2008_djvu.txt).


There are three guiding principles for me:

1. Open data - Choose services where I can get the data out and is it in a usable format? (ideally [git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29) interface allowing pull **and push**)
2. Decentralised - **Avoid services** where there is an obvious concentration of power
3. Opensource - Choose software where I can transparently see changes, has manageable source code so that it can be forked (ideally using git with full history)

Notice that I haven't requested some encryption adoption or privacy here. I
feel if things are **sufficiently decentralised**, that would satisfy me for
needs of privacy.

Some examples:

### Email

**Gmail** is not opensource. It's incredibly centralised so that if an enemy had
access to Gmail, and lets imagine most people use Gmail as their email client, by
and large that enemy could read your email. Gmail does make it possible to get
your data out, so score is 1 of 3.

What is the alternative? Using another email provider. Email is an open
standard designed to be decentralised, so this should be an easy task. Sadly
most email providers suck. I've chosen <https://www.fastmail.fm/>, since they
aren't as big as Gmail (this is decentralised in my book) and their Web client
is comparable in terms of features with Gmail. So Fastmail gets a score of 2 of
3.

Ideally I would host my own email, but it takes too much effort for me.

### Chat

A lot of people lately are saying, lets chat on [Slack](https://slack.com/)!
Fail! AFAIK it doesn't allow you to get your data out, it's obviously
centralised and it's not opensource. Why even consider it?

The alternative is clear in my book. <abbr title="Inter Relay Chat">IRC</abbr>, which is 3 of 3. Though don't expect
private communication.

### Social networks

Before someone criticizes my "guiding principles" of my usage of Facebook or
Twitter, can I just point out that I do not expect privacy on either platform.

Twitter (1 of 3) is better than Facebook (0 of 3) since their APIs for 'Open
data', i.e. getting your data back out are sane compared to Facebook. Case in
point: <http://greptweet.com/>

## Final word

An online life is complex. I tried to keep these 3 principles; Open Access,
**Decentralisation** & Opensource as simple as possible, to help me and
hopefully you make better decisions that should aid privacy and increase
competitiveness of our wonderful Internet!
