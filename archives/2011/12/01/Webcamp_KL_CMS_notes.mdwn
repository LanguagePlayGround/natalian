Firstly I did greatly enjoy [Webcamp KL](http://webcamp.my) last night. Though
I think we need a bigger venue and food/drink next time [Wu
Han](http://twitter.com/#!/ngeow).  :)

So Wordpress, Drupal & Joomla were stuck off my list for being firstly bloated,
probably requiring mysql and full of crappy 3rd party plugins / modules. Hell
noes!

A friend Simon Waters comments on this 3rd party nightmare:

	Some of what I see is module authors trying to poke too hard, when what they
	are doing might be better done by extending the system itself rather than as a
	module. Some of it no doubt is just incompetence. I don't seem to have problems
	with Drupal plugins in the same way as much, but that might be luck, or it
	might be that Drupal has so much basic functionality is implemented as modules
	that the handling of them is more mature?

[MongoPress](http://www.mongopress.org) looked interesting, but I thought it
looked too fresh to try. It's worringly 26k of PHP with a rewrite coming.

So I'm not your typical CMS user. I don't need a nice interface. I want my
content sensibly in git and to generate static content. Much like I am
[doing](http://natalian.org/) [already](http://geekout.org.uk/).

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) introduced by
[Lim](http://twitter.com/#!/bearwithclaws) of [Hacker
Monthly](http://hackermonthly.com/) fame took my fancy. The problem I have with
[ikiwiki](http://ikiwiki.info/) & [suckless](http://suckless.org)'s
[werc](http://hg.suckless.org/werc-garbeam/) is they don't do
[pagination](http://ikiwiki.info/todo/Pagination_next_prev_links/) which I'm a
fan of when it comes to navigation.

 I'm wondering how easy it is to [migrate to
Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/blog-migrations) from my ikiwiki
markdown [ikiwiki
sources](http://source.natalian-org.branchable.com/?p=source.git;) to a Jekyll
produced site?

`yaourt ruby-jekyll` and off we go:

	==> ruby-jekyll dependencies:
	 - ruby (package found)
	 - ruby-albino>=1.3.2 (building from AUR)
	 - ruby-classifier>=1.3.1 (building from AUR)
	 - ruby-directory_watcher>=1.1.1 (building from AUR)
	 - ruby-kramdown-last>=0.13.2 (building from AUR)
	 - ruby-liquid>=1.9.0 (building from AUR)
	 - ruby-maruku>=0.5.9 (building from AUR)
	 - ruby-redcloth>=4.2.1 (building from AUR)
	 - rubygems (package found)

This takes ages to install on Archlinux. I'm never too sure if I should rely on
[Archlinux packages or gem](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Ruby)...
though I would seriously resent having to run `gem update --system` or whatever
it is as well as Arch's `yaourt -Syua`. I blame MacOSX for having a
"non-package" management system.

I do moan about Jekyll dependencies, but I guess [ikiwiki's
dependencies](http://packages.debian.org/source/unstable/ikiwiki) are just as
many. It's just that I don't notice them much when I do a `apt-get install
ikiwiki`.

My first run of Jekyll looks like:

	x220:/tmp/foobar$ jekyll 
	/usr/lib/ruby/1.9.1/rubygems/custom_require.rb:36:in `require': iconv will be deprecated in the future, use String#encode instead.
	WARNING: Could not read configuration. Using defaults (and options).
			No such file or directory - /tmp/foobar/_config.yml
	Building site: /tmp/foobar -> /tmp/foobar/_site
	Successfully generated site: /tmp/foobar -> /tmp/foobar/_site
	x220:/tmp/foobar$ ls _site
	ls: cannot access _site: No such file or directory

Er, wtf? [Usage](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Usage) docs aren't
inspiring me. Need to use YML (urgh), rename my posts to a
"YEAR-MONTH-DATE-title.MARKUP", ok... I can do that. Luckily I got unstuck by
using some [Jekyll site sources](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Sites).

	find ~/wikis/natalian-org.branchable.com/archives -name '*.mdwn' | grep -E '20[0-9][0-9]/[0-9][0-9]/[0-9][0-9]' | while read blog
	do
		IFS=/
		set -- $blog
		postname=$(basename ${10} .mdwn)
		dest=./$7-$8-$9-$postname.md
		IFS=""
	cat <<END > $dest
	---
	layout: post
	title: $(echo $postname | tr '_' ' ')
	---
	END
		cat $blog >> $dest
	done

Wow, Jekyll has forced me to correct my posture. It's so fast compared to
ikiwiki (could be my new [SSD](http://natalian.org/archives/2011/11/10/Thinkpad_X220/) though).
[Pagination](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/template-data) works! I like the clean layout.

So far I am very impressed with the output at <http://jekyll.natalian.org>! :)

Outstanding issues:

* [Related posts](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/jekyll-rb/Related$20Posts/jekyll-rb/coFvolhPbD4/9rJCL56ebZQJ) don't work. Oh well, a feature I don't need.
* Need to figure out how I should rewrite the "archives" bit to make sure my links don't break between for e.g. <http://jekyll.natalian.org/2004/02/01/homecam.html> & <http://natalian.org/archives/2004/02/01/homecam/>
* How to import the comments? `$ find -name '*._comment' | wc -l` says I have 1358 to worry about
* Does Jekyll do a calendar? gah, I don't care.
* I expect URLs like <http://jekyll.natalian.org/2011/04/> (all post from April 2011) to look a little nicer, not sure how to solve this
