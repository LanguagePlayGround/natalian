I found <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16288247> quite interesting.
Firstly I wish I could annotate the page and embed in the blog instead of
commenting of items out of context.

Haven't played with "Enterprise social networking tools" such as Chatter,
Salesforce, Yammer or Jive. I like to think a company's heartbeat is Bugzilla
or Pivotal tracker.  I'm guessing these are dumbed down or perhaps better
focused on sales (the bottom line). Combat my ignorance, someone please.

"Another thing to watch for is that Google may lose control of Android." is a
comment I guess because Amazon has usurped the tablet side of things for
pushing its [kindle Fire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindle_Fire)  et al.
Firstly I think the _Honeycomb release_ bombed (funnily it's not used on the
"Fire" AFAICT) and I don't think Googlers are interested in the tablet form
factor anymore. They would rather concentrate on mobile devices. Also I think
the Android based Kindles _suck_ compared to their own unamed OS.

Didn't realise RIM were in such a bad state.
[7.44BN](http://www.google.com/finance?q=RIM) market cap isn't great for this
cruel industry. I don't see what RIM can offer. It's too entrenched in their
[retarded enterprise model](http://shkspr.mobi/blog/index.php/2011/03/the-death-of-the-blackberry/).

NFC is something I've thought a lot about and I'm still a bit dubious. Is
"wireless payments" the one killer app? Sounds **lame** to me. I think a VISA
chip&pin card is far more versatile.

"big data" sounds like a new word to describe an old problem like "data
mining". Bollocks.

Ipad/Apple/Iphone ... what will that do next... I find this technology
deferment to Apple fucking irritating to say the least. Sad thing is Apple's
competitors are completely retarded, so... I guess I will have to defer to Apple too.

3D printing has a nice mention. Check out <http://www.tinkercad.com/> if you
haven't already.

I do find Zynga quite interesting. Especially since it's titles like "Word for
friends" sucks compared to [Wordfued](http://wordfeud.com). I guess Zynga has
the platform which has value... even though it's a sharecropper to Facebook.
Right?  The quote "Zynga has probably 50-60% of the social gaming market.  The
biggest company in mobile gaming has a 1.5% share." sounds like bullshit. 1.5%
of what platform exactly?

Bring your own device (BYOD) is something I've _always_ done. There is a term
for it?  I feel sorry for people working under oppressive IT regimes. Get a job
that doesn't suck.

I really don't believe in the Enterprise "secure the network" intranet
bullshit.

"internet of things" from Gartner sounds like an old idea, regurgitated for
today. What do you expect from analysts?

# My predictions

Ok after taking the piss from the "experts", what do I have to bring to the
table?

I would like to predict a year where Internet users start to shun services like
Facebook & twitter and even Gmail. I.e. folks start running their own
distributed standardised services. Unfortunately I think we are still a few
years off that, so I predict things will just get worse. FB, twitter &
incumbents like Google will just get more and more annoying.
