I've been using [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) for
years. Since the [South African
BBS](http://www.africa.upenn.edu/BBS_Internet/South_Africa_11689.html)
Connectix days, on ZAnet #durban.

During boarding school I took a break from all things Internet, but by Bath
University I was back... this time on Quakenet. Thanks to Quake & QWTF clans.
There is a chat channel on Quakenet with a few hardcore
[BUNCS](http://www.buncs.com) members from 1998 that we are still on.

Since University I've had a VPS and long enjoyed a screen & irssi session on
Freenode to complement most of my working activities. I've lurked on
[#whatwg](http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/IRC) since its inception and I've asked
countless stupid questions on a variety channels like #bash with familiar
regulars like greycat & twkm.

I've also been on OFTC for years, mainly because of Debian projects like Debian
Live & lately ikiwiki.

Refreshingly the [W3C](http://www.w3.org) as a organisation use
[IRC](http://www.w3.org/wiki/InternetRelayChat) to facilitate meetings. It has
a rather excellent [bot](http://www.w3.org/2001/12/zakim-irc-bot) to help
scribe and produce minutes of meetings on the Web. Really would like to see
more of this.

I like to think I've introduced some folks to IRC and I was quite pleased to
get 3 collegues recently on IRC. In my previous workplace we sat around the
table and we were all on Gtalk, so there was no need for a company IRC channel.

So the four of us on a Freenode channel was immediately controversial. Freenode
is **only** for "Free and Open Source Software communities" and we at the
company were mainly communicating tbh about company type bullshit. So where do
you go if you want an IRC channel for your company? Beats me. Update: Friends
tell me their companies run an ircd at their workplace... yikes... another
hurdle!

Btw [Unreal ircd](http://www.unrealircd.com) is 78k SLOC and the esteemed irc
client [irssi](http://irssi.org) is 65k SLOC... quite a lot of C tbh, for an
allegedly simple [IRC protocol](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459).

The barrier to entry to the world of IRC communication is outrageously high for
businesses.

Setting up chanserv for the "business" channel to cater for employees with a
password or rather to limit a certain IP range is non-trivial.

Next a distributed network probably requires some sort of nick registration.
Took me personally ages to bother to register my nick on Freenode. Scripting a
nickserv identify rule for a variety of IRC clients is another PITA.

Then there is question of users who connect from their local machines and
basically drop off (leaving countless annoying quit and joined messages) when
they for example change between `wlan0` and `eth0`. Hence **missing out on a
potential backlog of messages**. My colleagues are smart people, but I can't
get all of them to use tmux/screen & irssi can I?! It's expensive for a start.

Furthermore I have the problem where the usual shell I run `irssi` in the UK is
just too slow from Malaysia. So what now? Get a new VPS and re-configure stuff
like IP masks? What a massive & _expensive_ PITA.

So with the problems outlayed above, I think IRC is seriously in trouble. It
really rang true for me as the co-working space in Malaysia, full of smart
people... I'm the only person on IRC. They prefer
[Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) or Gtalk for discussions. Lack of
Asian IRC servers is also a little worrying.

I like to think IRC could pull through well into 21st century if they solved
the back channel (reconnect) problem and if IRC had a **decent** Web front end.
Freenode's [webchat seems broken](http://blog.freenode.net/category/webchat/)
half the time, for example too many connections from one IP.

During a fun IRC discourse on [#suckless](http://suckless.org/community),
[cls](http://twitter.com/#!/lubutu) adds:

* no backlogging
* no good authentication
* usually sent in plaintext (not utf8 I assume)
* we have multiple incompatible networks...

kfx recalls the defunct project
[irc+](http://web.archive.org/web/20100204101713/http://www.irc-plus.org/en/),
where he said it died because "nobody gives a shit".
