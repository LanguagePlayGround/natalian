I must confess I started using an Iphone4 whilst on the [2011 Mongol
Rally](http://geekout.org.uk). I had the phone through work, though I didn't
have a good reason to use the Iphone until on the trip.

The Iphone4 feature I fell in love with with its **camera**. It also take
excellent videos too and it was pure joy to look back on them in the Photos
application and the places was a sheer bonus.

I ditched my [[Canon_IXUS_1000_HS|archives/2010/10/11/Canon_IXUS_1000_HS]]
months ago because it sucked. The Iphone or NexusS feature I can't live without
is [Geotagging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotagging). I did come across a
[small Canon camera with a geotagging
feature](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6190494723/), but the sales person
said you need to use special software to enable it. Fuck that! Even if the
sales person was wrong, a [GPS lock
wait](http://www.cameralabs.com/reviews/Canon_PowerShot_SX230_HS/) seems to be
the case. Again the Iphone4 seems really fast, faster than the Android NexusS
for geotagging an image. In fact, what I love about the Iphone4, it doesn't
even show it's geotagging. It just does it, so it's just one less thing to
worry about.

This Tuesday I have to return my work Iphone4 since I am moving to Malaysia and
I will have to return to using the Nexus S was has a long list of faults.

It's incredibly sluggish, like walking through mud when using it. The Android
keyboard is almost unusable next to the Iphone4's.

The NexusS battery is insanely bad. It's half way when the Iphone4 would be 80%
doing more things. The Iphone4 also seems to charge incredibly quickly, unlike
the NexusS.

The screen on the Iphone4 feels bigger. Using the NexusS is like using a screen
that's half this size... the NexusS feels claustrophobic next to the Iphone4.

Some things about the Iphone4 that sucked are:

* Had to get operator to allow the wifi spot feature which I could never get my laptop connected to
* Apple's Mail client sucks
* You can't tether and that just super sucks. Android tehtering is a joy.
* Don't understand notifications on Ios5. For e.g. it tells me I have FB update, but it's sluggish to open FB app and then I have to update again to see the message. w.t.f.? (Still it's better than say tweetdeck falling over all the time on Android)
* [Mounting the Iphone4 filesystem from Archlinux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/IPod) broke on the ios5 update which seriously pissed me off. So I had to email off all the pictures I took which is frankly unworkable going forward.

Besides those complaints I will seriously miss the Iphone4. I hate to sound like a complete fan boy, but I don't think I can cope without it. :(

NexusS takes horrible pictures and just the sluggish UI will piss me off no
end.  Android 3 seems even slower than the 2.3.6... so this feels seriously
like a down grade and I don't see Android rectifying their sucky trajectory.

I want to keep with a more "open phone" like Android, but tbh I also like to
argue I care about the browser. For me in the mobile Web industry, I feel
Safari on Iphone is the browser to target.
