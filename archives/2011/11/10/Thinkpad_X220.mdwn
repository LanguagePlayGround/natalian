Upgraded to a Thinkpad X220 model 4287CTO from a X201.

A 64bit Archlinux install on a 166GBP OCZ 120GB Nocti SSD - mSATA SATA-II - Read
280MB/s Write 260MB/s from [Ebuyer](http://www.ebuyer.com/284727-ocz-120gb-nocti-ssd-msata-sata-ii-read-280mb-s-write-260mb-s-noc-msata-120g) went well. I can't verify the [SSDs speeds](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSD_Benchmarking), but they are much faster than the Seagate 500GB Momentus XT Hybrid SSD in my [[archives/2011/01/16/Archlinux_SSD_upgrade_from_Ubuntu|X201 with Archlinux]].

I opted for syslinux and I can boot into Windows using a chainload stanza or by
using the Thinkpad own BIOS boot menu. No more bloated Grub for me, and
syslinux does allow to alter the cmdline.

With `MODULES=(acpi-cpufreq cpufreq_ondemand cpufreq_powersave)` and
`/etc/conf.d/cpufreq:governor="ondemand"` configured, I do drop down to 800mhz
on all 4 processors. However the fan unlike my X201 is pretty much permamently
on. Argh! **NOISE** It is pretty hot on the side, so the X220 seems to exhibit
some cooling issues. :( I'm not sure who to turn to. I don't think there is any
point trying to turn off the noisy fan if it feels hot to the touch!

Another problem is the wifi. `wifi-select wlan0` doesn't seem to want to join
an open network. The problem seems similar to issue documented with my X201 and
[[archives/2011/09/28/DHCP_IP_lease_attempt_failed_on_Archlinx/]]. I've also
found general complaints about the [Intel iwalgn
driver](https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/10/15/107).  My workaround is to `sudo
iwconfig wlan0 essid praze`, `sudo iwconfig wlan0 key off` & `sudo dhcpcd
wlan0` manually to get connected!

Another issue is the card reader. `mmcblk0: timed out sending r/w cmd
command, card status 0x700`, sdhci/mmcblk0 b0rks with errors and `REGISTER
DUMP (mmc0)` all over the shop when I put in an sdcard, which works
**fine** on the X201. No idea what to do here. :(

The 9 cell battery only seems to get 4.5hrs out of it. There is probably some
tweaking I can do. Doesn't help that `powertop` doesn't work because it isn't
ported to /sysfs IIUC. :( The 9 cell upgrade wasn't much money, but I think I
would have gone for the smaller battery now, knowing what I do now.

I like the new wider & clearer screen. It suits me well with a [tiling window
manager dwm](http://dwm.suckless.org/). The little webcam (HD 720p) is also an
improvement over the one embedded in the screen in the X201. I also think the
keyboard is slightly better too, with the fat ESC & Delete keys that suit a
**vim** user well.

Of course I disabled the Trackpad in favour of the trackpoint in the BIOS, but
it is a unnerving to accidentally depress it from time to time. I think the
case is falling apart.

Occassionally the Windows hard drive spins up and makes a funny noise, even
though it's not in use. Not sure what I can do about this... perhaps I should
take it out. ;)

I must say buying a laptop from <http://shop.lenovo.com/> (powered by Digital River) was a little insane. It exhibited a myriad of problems, most of which I've cleared my mind off, less I go insane.
* Timing out (joy at having to pick all the parts I want again ...)
* Failed to login (I think my login is for the US site which doesn't work in the UK site), ended up ordering without an account, completely daft
* Awful, god awful forms
* Conflicting information about the on-site warranty, needed to call up

[Lenovo UK on twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/lenovo_uk) thankfully were slightly useful.

The [UPS](http://www.ups.com/) shipment progress was also pretty rediculous. The laptop started in China on 11/03/2011, then it went to:
* Castle Donnington, United Kingdom
* Back to Shanghai, China (w.t.f!)
* Incheon, Korea, Republic of
* Almaty, Kazakhstan
* Warsaw, Poland
* Koeln, Germany
* Castle Donnington, United Kingdom
* Exeter, United Kingdom 11/08/2011
