If you routinely use Archlinux's `sudo wifi-select wlan0` UI to get online, you
might have seen this dreaded error message:

	DHCP IP lease attempt failed.

After Googling I found these two links interesting:

# Solutions to try

## Clear dhcpcd leases

Nuke leaeses in `/var/lib/dhcpcd`

	rm /var/lib/dhcpcd/*

## Switch to dhclient (providing you have it installed)

Add `DHCLIENT=yes`

	hendry@x201 network.d$ cat /etc/network.d/Fluent\ Space | grep DHCLIENT
	DHCLIENT=yes

There is a bunch of [Archlinux wireless quirk switches to try
too](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Netcfg#Driver_quirks) and of course
bumping up the TIMEOUT value.
