If you are unlucky enough to work in a corporate environment where they don't
trust your Linux machine to send mail, you probably need to relay to some
fucked up Exchange server like <http://www.themessagecenter.com/> provide. Poor
you.

Since [SSMTP](http://packages.qa.debian.org/s/ssmtp.html) sucks, since:

* cron jobs didn't seem to work on ssmtp
* does not provide per user config
* [lots of bugs](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?repeatmerged=no&src=ssmtp)
* the fact that's [SSMTP is no longer developed since 2009](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSMTP)

I spent a morning migrating from `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf` to `~/.msmtprc`. The
reason why it took so long as msmtp's "auth on" didn't work and after a log of
debugging, I found the solution to be **auth login**.

So this is my `~/.msmtprc`:

	logfile ~/.msmtp.log
	auth login
	from kai.hendry@example.com
	host mail.securembox.com
	user kai.hendry@example.com
	password secret

My old `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf`

	hendry@deb02:~$ grep -v "^#" /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf  | grep .
	root=hendry
	mailhub=mail.securembox.com
	AuthUser=kai.hendry@example.com
	AuthPass=secret
	hostname=deb02.jil.org
	FromLineOverride=Yes

You can tell you have authorisation problem with your relay if your spits out
like "550 5.7.1 Unable to relay".

	Jan 31 10:49:22 host=mail.securembox.com tls=off auth=off from=kai.hendry@example.com recipients=kai.hendry@foo.org smtpstatus=550 smtpmsg='550 5.7.1 Unable to relay' errormsg='recipient address kai.hendry@foo.org not accepted by the server' exitcode=EX_DATAERR

The "auth=off" should be a dead giveaway.

# Debug tips

With thanks from <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/MSMTP>.

Test mail:

	$ cat test.mail
	To: kai.hendry@foo.org
	From: kai.hendry@example.com
	Subject: A test

	Yadda, yadda, yadda

SSMTP debugging:

	cat test.mail | /usr/sbin/ssmtp -d5 kai.hendry@foo.org

the MSMTP log to compare to:

	cat test.mail | msmtp -d  kai.hendry@foo.org

Good luck
