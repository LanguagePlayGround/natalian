I'm a bit fan of <http://aaisp.net/> though since they don't offer all-in-one,
all you can eat packages, it can be difficult to recommend.

Take for example you've bought a pub and you can start from scratch. Actually
not quite, this [premises](http://www.voa.gov.uk) has a BT business line which
is a huge PITA to switch to residential. AFAIK a BT business line doesn't give
you anything except a minimal compensation when the line is faulty. All that for
50% extra line rental a month. An insurance rip off.

So the pub (or any business) needs good internet and in fact you need cordless
telephone most of all since you are going to be talking a lot with suppliers.
Also you want to supply punters with Internet (thankfully mostly evening/weekend
usage).

So if we setup the [20CN line](http://aaisp.net.uk/broadband-20.html) with
[AAISP](http://aaisp.net.uk/), we are talking:

* 10GBP PSTN take over - or you can leave it with BT because AAISP doesn't do PSTN calls
* 50GBP Internet install

So 60GBP to get started and the ZyXEL router comes free

* 12.20GBP line rental
* 7GBP for the very basic (2 unit) Internet

So at the very least 19.40GBP ongoing cost pcm. That's the starting price for
decent Internet. So lets say it's a 50GBP cost to get started and 240GBP a year
for Internet.

Now with Internet we can start to use VOIP instead of PSTN calls. VOIP is far
more flexible, full featured, cheaper calls (esp international) and can offer
better voice quality. Lets assume you keep the PSTN number as emergency backup,
you now have many several VOIP solutions like:

* Skype (strictly speaking Skype doesn't do standard VOIP)
* <http://www.gradwell.com/>
* <http://www.vonage.co.uk/>
* And AAISP [telecoms](http://aaisp.net.uk/telecoms-prices.html)

# VOIP Equipment

For Skype you generally need a PC or a [Skype
phone](http://shop.skype.com/intl/en-gb/phones/). This sucks because Skype is a
proprietary protocol, so if you buy say the familiar cordless phone for running
around the premises, it can only work with Skype and no other provider. You
become tied to Skype, though Skype do offer very good service IMO.

Gradwell sell the open standard [VOIP phone](http://store.gradwell.com/) wares,
which is good. I'm quite partial to the Siemens Gigaset a580IP as this is the
same [equipment AAISP](http://aaisp.net.uk/telecoms-equipment.html) pitches.

[Vonage's equipment](http://www.vonage.co.uk/how-vonage-works/equipment/) is
interesting because it's free and it works with old PSTN devices. So no special
VOIP hardware, though I'm concerned you lose some features. However if you just
dial with the damn thing, you probably will not care.

# VOIP cost

So the all-in-one deals like [TalkTalk's is about 286GBP a
year](http://sales.talktalk.co.uk/product/compare/broadband). This is a poor
benchmark as I've heard countless stories how awful their service is. Perhaps
TalkTalk are a victim of their own success, however if we compare this to
AAISP's 240GBP a year, that only gives us about 50GBP a year for calls to play
with.

Vonage's equivalent to TalkTalk's is roughly 72GBP a year with a 25GBP setup
cost. So for quality AAISP Internet and Vonage which I've heard is very good,
you're only paying an ongoing cost of 22GBP extra a year. Not too bad, though
this plan breaks down if a lot of AAISP Internet units are used.

[Gradwell's](http://www.gradwell.com/phoneservices/singleuser) comparable "all
you can eat" UK telephony offer seems to roughly 4+8GBP a month which I
estimate 144GBP a year.

AAISP do not offer all you can eat, though [AAISP's call
charges](http://aaisp.net.uk/telecoms-prices.html) are not very competitive,
however their service is very good, and it's awesome to have broadband and VOIP
together on their [control panel](https://clueless.aaisp.net.uk/main.cgi).

# Conclusion since you and I are getting thirsty

Lets say AAISP and the selected VOIP providers are just twice as good as Talk
Talks offerings. IMHO AAISP are in orders of magnitude better and you get a ton
of powerful features and flexibility with a a daunting BT + AAISP + VOIP
provider setup.

As iterated above, one light user **could** compete with TalkTalk's all in one
offer. Tbh I think the cost of extra AAISP units could make the cost about
400GBP a year, so really I would suggest something that's going to at LEAST
twice as good it's going to cost you just twice as much.
