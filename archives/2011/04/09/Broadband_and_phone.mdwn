I'm a bit of a fan of <http://aaisp.net/> though since they don't offer
"all-in-one", "all you can eat" packages, it can be difficult to recommend to
friends and family. They also don't really do line rental, since they do not
offer PSTN calls (so you won't need [PSTN take
over](http://aaisp.net.uk/broadband-prices-full.html) if you have a line
already or PSTN provision if you line is off). You want PSTN calls, although
I'll later get onto VOIP since it's a good backup in emergencies, especially if
you have only one line, which in this example is the case.

So you've bought a pub and you can start from scratch. Actually not quite, this
[premises](http://www.voa.gov.uk) has a **BT business line** which is a huge
PITA to switch to residential. AFAIK a BT business line doesn't give you
anything except a minimal compensation when the line is faulty. All that for
50% extra line rental a month. An insurance rip off.

So the pub (or any business) needs good reliable internet and in fact you need
cordless telephone most of all since you are going to be talking a lot with
suppliers.  Also you want to supply punters with Internet (thankfully mostly
evening/weekend usage).

So if we setup the [20CN line](http://aaisp.net.uk/broadband-20.html) with
[AAISP](http://aaisp.net.uk/), we are talking:

* BT line rental, lets say it's 15GBP pcm for argument sake
* 50GBP initial Internet install, with the [AAISP broadband equipment](http://aa.net.uk/broadband-accessories.html)
[ZyXEL router comes free](http://aaisp.net.uk/broadband-freerouter.html)
and [19.40GBP per
month](http://aaisp.net.uk/broadband-prices.html) at an absolute minimum

AAISP's monthly cost of 34.4GBP including line rental is pretty pricey.

So we are talking 232.8GBP a year for Internet and 180GBP BT line rental, which
is 412.8GBP for the year altogether.

# Now for the calls

Now with quality Internet we can start to use VOIP instead of PSTN calls. VOIP is far
more flexible, full featured, cheaper calls (esp international) and can offer
better voice quality. Lets assume you keep the PSTN number as emergency backup,
you now have many several VOIP solutions like:

* [Skype](http://www.skype.com) (strictly speaking Skype doesn't do standard VOIP)
* <http://www.gradwell.com/>
* <http://www.vonage.co.uk/>
* And AAISP [telecoms](http://aaisp.net.uk/telecoms-prices.html)

# VOIP Equipment

For Skype you generally need a PC or a [Skype
phone](http://shop.skype.com/intl/en-gb/phones/). This sucks because Skype is a
proprietary protocol, so if you buy say the familiar cordless phone for running
around the premises, it will probably only work with Skype and no other VOIP
provider.  You become tied to Skype, though Skype do offer a very good
(firewall busting) service IMO.

[Gradwell](http://www.gradwell.com/) sell the open standard [VOIP
phone](http://store.gradwell.com/) wares, which is good. I'm quite partial to
the Siemens Gigaset a580IP as this is the same [equipment
AAISP](http://aaisp.net.uk/telecoms-equipment.html) pitches.

[Vonage's equipment](http://www.vonage.co.uk/how-vonage-works/equipment/) is
interesting because it's free and it works with old PSTN devices. So no special
VOIP hardware, though I'm concerned you lose some features. However if you just
dial with the damn thing, you probably will not care.

# VOIP cost

So the all-in-one deals like [TalkTalk's is about 286GBP a
year](http://sales.talktalk.co.uk/product/compare/broadband). This is a poor
benchmark as I've heard countless stories how awful their service is. Perhaps
TalkTalk are a victim of their own success, however if we compare this to
AAISP's 412GBP a year without calls.

However enter the **murky world of broadband business** and Talktalk's all
inclusive equivalent seems to be 10GBP for internet, 13.50GBP for line rental &
15GBP for calls. So altogether the business benchmark per year is 462GBP, which
give us 50GBP for calls to play with ontop of AAISP.

Vonage's equivalent to TalkTalk's is roughly 72GBP a year with a 25GBP setup
cost. So for quality AAISP Internet and Vonage which I've heard is very good,
you're only paying an ongoing cost of 22GBP extra a year. Not too bad, though
this plan breaks down if a lot of AAISP Internet units are used.

[Gradwell's](http://www.gradwell.com/phoneservices/singleuser) comparable "all
you can eat" UK telephony offer seems to roughly 4+8GBP a month which I
estimate to be 144GBP a year.

AAISP do not offer all you can eat, though [AAISP's call
charges](http://aaisp.net.uk/telecoms-prices.html) are not very competitive,
however their service is very good, and it's awesome to have broadband and VOIP
together on their [control panel](https://clueless.aaisp.net.uk/main.cgi).

# Conclusion since you and I are getting thirsty

Lets say AAISP and the selected VOIP providers are just twice as good as Talk
Talks offerings. IMHO AAISP are in orders of magnitude better and you get a ton
of powerful features and flexibility with a a daunting BT + AAISP + VOIP
provider setup.

As iterated above, one light user **could** compete with TalkTalk's all in one
**business** offer. Tbh I think the cost of extra AAISP units (they don't do
unlimited) could make the cost closer to 600GBP a year, so really I would
suggest something that's going to at LEAST twice as good it's going to cost you
just 50% extra and give you a lot more flexibility WRT calls, though a bit of a
headache paying BT, AAISP & your VOIP provider.
