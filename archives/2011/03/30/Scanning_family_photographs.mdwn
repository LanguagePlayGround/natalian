Last weekend I [rented a Kodak
S1220](http://www.scannerhire.co.uk/graphic-scanners-for-hire/photo-scanners-for-hire/s1220-photo-scanner.html)
and scanned a drawer full of 6238 old family photographs with the [help of my
parents](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/5570248439/).

Make sure your working area is free of dust and grime. Better still wipe the
pictures before you scan them, other wise you'll get [poor
results](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/5560500523/) and possibly clog up
the scanner transport.

300 dpi is fine and much faster than 600dpi.

I left the image cleaner tool on, it didn't really seem to make a difference.

On the runs I noticed "streaking" (a line down the scan), I checked/cleaned the scanner
and redid the batch.

No way to start the scan from the scanner device itself, which sucks. You had
to use the horrid Kodak scanning software to kick off the batch. So there was a
lot of "You ready Dad?" "Yeah!" or "You ready Kai?" "Yeah!", and what we be
much better if he just pressed the button on the device.

The user experience of the Kodak software is just crazy. 7 steps for something
that should be one.

1. Order #, Continue
* Click Batch Scan
* Scanning Complete
* Are you done? Yes
* Folder view, Continue
* Finalize Order
* Do you want to start a new Kodak s1220 Scan Session?

The Kodak software is awful, the theme is insulting and any operation was
crazy slow. Rotatating all the images took ten times longer than Picasa.

The Kodak software refuses to do a batch scan unless a [red USB key
fob](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/5574076175/) is plugged in. This is
extraordinary. I looked at the manual and they say "DO NOT LOSE THIS". Why have
it all? It's terribly confusing. I thought it had the software on the stick,
but the computer wouldn't recognise it. It took far too long to realise this
was some sort of physical key to make the scanner operate correctly. Madness.

I have to do a ton of post-processing and I think Picasa will be my tool of
choice. You can bulk alter EXIF time, add geolocation painlessly and add tags.
