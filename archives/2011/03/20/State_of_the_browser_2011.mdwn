Yesterday I dragged myself across town to [State of the
browser](http://browser.londonwebstandards.org) and I'm glad I did.

Amazingly the [Jubilee line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jubilee_line) was
working this weekend and it was a pleasant journey from Baker street to North
Greenwich while listening to [The
Bugle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bugle) via [Google
listen](http://listen.googlelabs.com/).

Upon arriving I introduced myself to a Mozillan <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gervase_Markham_(programmer)">Gerv</a> and
we had a varied discussion from [Bugzilla](http://www.bugzilla.org) to the
[Mongol Rally](http://geekout.org.uk). Bugzilla definitely looks like the
premier BTS right now. It's frankly insane I have to use
[Redmine](http://www.redmine.org) at work. :/

Once the room opened I must have spent the next two hours working out how to
connect to the [Ravensbourne](http://www.rave.ac.uk/) wireless.

The `/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf` snippet that had me connected for minutes at a
time was:

	network={
		ssid="eduroam"
		scan_ssid=1
		key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
		eap=PEAP
		identity="RGuest057@rave.ac.uk"
		password="ChufJelQue"
	}

I don't know if this a [ja.net](http://www.ja.net/) requirement or not, but I
must say I was fucking seething. Why does it have to be so hard to get
Internet?  :( Unfortunately my Vodafone SIM was only giving me GPRS, so I
couldn't tether.

I did manage to get my Android device connected more reliably to the
[Ravensbourne](http://www.rave.ac.uk/) wireless, but I bizaarely [couldn't
tether my laptop over
USB](http://twitter.com/#!/kaihendry/status/49053920332484608) to it! :(

So I listened to [@mahemoff](http://twitter.com/#!/mahemoff) and noted:

* <http://www.chromium.org/developers/web-platform-status>
* <http://crbug.com>
* <http://www.appmator.com/> which is kinda like my <http://saveaswidget.com/>, though only for Chrome ;)
* Background pages sounded interesting
* Liked the description of extensions, packaged apps & hosted apps
* Hosted apps are what I like to think of shortcuts to a Web application

Next I was very impressed by [Paul Rouget](http://twitter.com/#!/paulrouget),
who came across as a very competent hacker. The Audio API and other demos
looked great. Later at the pub he was talking about his [slide
software](http://paulrouget.com/dzslides/) which can control what other people
see. Must look into that. :-)

There was really quite a good representation of Mozillans, fellow Durbanite
[cyberdees](http://twitter.com/#!/cyberdees) was around and two on my table,
Patrick Finch a UK expat in Sweden and the Romanian
[@irinasandu](http://twitter.com/#!/irinasandu). I did try Firefox on my
[Android Nexus S](http://dabase.com/android/Nexus_Second/) and that turned out
to be a embarrassing waste of time. It's practically unusable and I'm worried
for Mozilla because their mobile ports suck so bad.

Thankfully there was lunch and I met Kiwi
[@toni_b](http://twitter.com/#!/toni_b) who seemed sane. I am not sure. She
told me I'd like Wellington if I like wind and earthquakes. Gulp.

After lunch I attended two great break out sessions. The fantastically
eccentric [Simon Stewart](http://twitter.com/#!/shs96c) gave a great talk about
"regression testing" with selenium or selenium2 or WebDiver. I asked several
questions and he answered them well. What a great guy. :) Importantly for my
own ego, the approach I was taking in my own testing at
[BONDI](http://tests.bondi.omtp.org/) & [WAC](http://tcs.wacapps.net/) didn't
seem so bad.

	1) Interrogate the DOM
	2) Ability to execute arbitary javascript
	1&2 = "browser reading"
	3) Ability to interact -- can't be done with JS

	logical failure

	browser specific bugs

	saucelabs -- jason huggins
	browsermob

	record people remotely - no

	going back to JS API - use qunit

Next I accidentally found myself listening to the Dos and Don'ts of the mobile
Web thinking this would be a waste of time. I was surprised to hear a familiar
sounding name "Staikos". Turns out Matthew Staikos, brother of George Staikos
of [Torch mobile](http://www.torchmobile.com/) was speaking! Holy cow! RIM have
the sent one of the the real browser guys, which was great. His talk was great
and I want to give WebWorks a whirl, however there doesn't seem to be an SDK
for Linux. :(

The final panel discussion was good, I asked a general question about which
features are typically not enabled on mobiles. The best question IMO came from
[@pornelski](http://twitter.com/#!/pornelski), who asked why didn't RIM, Chrome
& Firefox use the W3C widget packaging format. Opera of course already use the
format, because as Chris Mills mentions, they wrote it. ;) IIRC RIM/Chrome
dodged the question whilst Paul Rouget from Firefox was saying the standard
needed more, which I was surprised to hear. I expected him to say, Firefox
extensions came first or something. ;)

Later I went to a pub for a swift pint of ale to shockingly see Ireland beating
England at rugby. Oh well. @pornelski and @ernesto_jimenez were trying to
convince me [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) is a good idea.
[cramforce](http://twitter.com/#!/cramforce/status/49093759199223809) tried
earlier in the day and scared me with his "10x the amount of code" statement. I
was not impressed by "coffee script" generation of Javascript and the callback
orientated code. A sloccount of Node.js suggests 337k SLOC. Hmm, no thanks
guys!!  Nonetheless I must give [Server sent
events](http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/eventsource/basics/) a whirl real
soon now, hopefully on <http://greptweet.com/> to make the feedback sane.
