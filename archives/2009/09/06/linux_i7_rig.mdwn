I ordered the [[component_list|archives/2009/08/21/Building_a_PC]] on Friday
(28/8) and I picked up the components from work on Saturday (5/9) after
returning from
[Edinburgh](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/tags/edinburgh/).

<http://www.dabs.com/> seemed a little slow (more than a week to get everything
and I altered my list to ensure they had stock), gave me an authorisation form
twice to fill in, even though I have been a customer for several years and offer no
presales advice.

The presales question I asked dabs simply if the
[CPU](http://www.dabs.com/products/intel-nehalem-i7-920-s1366-2-66ghz-5CC9.html)
came with a stock cooler. Turns out it does. I did search about and it did seem
retail Intel CPU boxes contain a cooler, so I guess presales isn't really
necessary.

# Ebuyer's crappy compensation

Unfortunately the [case from Ebuyer](http://www.ebuyer.com/product/145090)
arrived [damaged](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/sets/72157622081037867/).
I called Ebuyer, who asked me to send the pictures, which I did, for
compensation. A week has gone by and they have not got back to me.
Disappointing.

Despite Ebuyer promising to discuss the matter with me, I have since noticed
Google checkout refunded me the grand total of **8GBP** for the damage to the
case door. That is a sad token amount, compared to even the time I spend
photographing, uploading and chasing up the problem. I am too lazy to take out
my mainboard and send it back to them and Ebuyer knows that. :(

# Building the PC

It was actually quite difficult to find a Phillips screwdriver with a magnetic
tip to build the PC. Eventually I found one, though the better looking ones
from B&Q, were the [PZ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pozidriv) types. So I
bought that one, worried that it might not be able to grip the Phillips screws,
but it was fine!

I was quite impressed with the Gigabyte EX58-UD3R motherboard heatsinks (no
fans, yay!).  Fitting the i7 CPU was a little scary as there aren't pins any
more and you have to be quite hard with the lever. I was also surprised to see
it had an IDE connector. Nice for an old CD drive to read legacy backup CDs.

The case seems quite large, but it seemed quite tight fitting the full
mainboard. I was surprised to see that the reset, power and HD leds were still
little fiddly cables. I thought that would become like a combined USB cable
after these years.

The VGA card that Dabs sold me is not a dual DVI. Dabs has mis-sold to me as their [Product page](http://www.dabs.com/products/xfx-geforce-9600gt-650mhz-512mb-ddr3-pcie-dvi-5DDW.html) clearly says "Dual DVI support"

Power up was scary. It didn't power up. I was worried the speaker was
malfunctioning as I expected an error beep. After losing my mind for 10
minutes, it turns out I didn't plug in the second ATX power cable. This is a
right 'balls up' IMO as the cable from the PSU is 4x4 and you are expected to
put it in a 8x8 connection on the motherboard near the CPU.

Thankfully I had it powered up and I tested everything worked by booting
[Webconverger from my USB keyring](http://webconverger.org/usb/).


The BIOS was a little old skool and gives way too many tweaks on memory.
Gigabyte are ricers. Need to figure out how the hell I am supposed to update
the BIOS should the need arise.

After inspecting the BIOS, it seemed that only 2G of my memory was being picked up as I fitted them right after one another. Memory voltage, speeds, acronyms seem really complicated nowadays. I moved one of the bars across and thankfully 4G showed up.

# Archlinux

I installed Archlinux from USB in about 5 minutes. It was that quick. I spent a
good 10 minutes trying to figure out X support with
[nvidia](http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA). The keyboard/mouse was
not working and it turned out that xf86-input-keyboard and xf86-input-mouse
were not installed. Wtf!

I installed `abs` and immediately tried to build `libwebkit`. Building Webkit
is something I do quite often at work on my [Thinkpad
X61](http://dabase.com/x61/) and it's painful and sweaty work. Needless to say
on the i7 building Webkit is insanely fast and satisfying.

# Quake Live

Getting up and running with [Quake Live](http://www.quakelive.com/) was pretty
quick. My name tag is [draq](http://www.quakelive.com/#profile/summary/draq)
btw. I was surprised it all worked so well without any tweaks. I ramped up the
graphics to fit my 1680x1050 Samsung and it runs 125+fps and _never goes down_.
I am serious. It's **really quick**. I am happy that I [took
advice](http://superuser.com/questions/30062/linux-i7-rig-for-quiet-stability-and-maybe-a-little-quake-live)
not to buy a more expensive graphics card. I read some Quake Live linux threads
WRT input lag. No input lag here.  Fantastic gameplay. [id
Software](http://www.idsoftware.com/) get a lot of love from me.  I wish there
were now more decent Linux games!

# Audio issues

I am not sure if this is Gigabyte's or Antec's fault. But the front side audio
once connected to the mainboard is noisy. :(

Connecting my headphones to the back of the case is the workaround.

# Is it noisy?

It's not noisy once I've booted into X for some bizaare reason. Why fans have to blast on a cold boot is beyond me.

# The VelociRaptor

[X61](http://dabase.com/x61/) is about 2663

	[root@i7 ~]# hdparm -T /dev/sda
	/dev/sda:
	Timing cached reads:   18948 MB in  2.00 seconds = 9487.43 MB/sec

X61 is about 38

	[root@i7 ~]# hdparm -t /dev/sda
	/dev/sda:
	Timing buffered disk reads:  358 MB in  3.01 seconds = 118.96 MB/sec

The hard drive is not noisy and it seems fast. I think I need to buy a huge slower hard drive and try a SSD one day.

# Overclocking

I heard the i7 920 is good to overclock to 3.2GHz from 2.67GHz. Unfortunately
`acpi` under Archlinux does not seem to report the CPU (or any) temperatures. I
am not too worried as I don't plan to switch this machine off.
