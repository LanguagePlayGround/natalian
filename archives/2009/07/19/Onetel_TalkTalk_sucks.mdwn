I've had my parents on Onetel for several years at [Praze Farm in
Cornwall](http://prazefarm.co.uk/) as they had cheaper line rental and calls
than [BT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Telecom).

However once we had problems with our line outside the house
[Onetel](http://onetel.co.uk/) proved to be incompetent in handling the BT
repair.

The first BT engineer arrived (I was not present) said there was no problem.
And then said it must be internal and replaced the ADSL filter. My parents were
charged almost 100GBP for this callout. There was nothing wrong with the ADSL
filter.

A few days later the line cut out completely. Again many hours were spent
calling Onetel's bewildering customer services (from a mobile) to get an
engineer out to fix the problem. This next engineer thankfully found the fault
outside on the pole and repaired it. The engineer himself said the previous
engineer didn't do his job properly in finding the fault outside.

We relayed the message to Onetel saying that we want our 100GBP back. We've
called again and again, and even wrote a letter. Onetel says they have passed
it on to the right "team" and we will receive a reply. Months have gone by and
still no reply.

Hence I really recommend you stay clear of [Onetel and
Talktalk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TalkTalk_%28telecommunications_company%29).

Now we moved back to BT for line rental. We also moved our mobile contract away
from Onetel too. All the money we saved using them probably didn't amount to
the 100GBP they took from us.
