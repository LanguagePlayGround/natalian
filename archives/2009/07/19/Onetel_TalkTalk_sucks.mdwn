I've had my parents on Onetel for several years at [Praze Farm in
Cornwall](http://prazefarm.co.uk/) as they had cheaper line rental and calls
than [BT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Telecom).

However once we had problems with our line outside the house
[Onetel](http://onetel.co.uk/) proved to be incompetent in handling the BT
repair.

The first BT engineer arrived said there was no problem. And said it must be
internal and replaced the ADSL filter. My parents were charged almost 100GBP
for this callout. There was nothing wrong with the ADSL filter.

A few days later the line cut out completely. Again many hours were spent
calling Onetel's bewildering customer services (from a mobile) to get an
engineer out to fix the problem. This next engineer thankfully found the fault
outside on the pole and repaired it. The engineer himself said the previous
engineer didn't do his job properly in finding the fault outside.

We relayed the message to Onetel saying that we want our 100GBP back. We've
called again and again, and even wrote a letter. Onetel says they have passed
it on to the team and we will receive a reply. Months have gone by and still no
reply.

Hence I really recommend you stay clear of Onetel and Talktalk. They really
suck.

Now we moved back to BT for line rental. We also moved our mobile contract away
from Onetel too.
