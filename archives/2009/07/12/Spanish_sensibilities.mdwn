Last week I was asked to attend a [BONDI codefest](http://bondi.omtp.org) in
Huesca, Spain. I happily accepted, though I was little bit worried
[Huesca](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huesca) was in the middle of nowhere.

Indeed I left [Jamie's 30th
birthday](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jamiekitson/tags/my30th/) on the South
Downs at 6:30am on Sunday morning (with only a couple of hours of sleep) to
embark on a long journey to Aragon via Gatwick and Madrid.

I [did not book the train in
advance](http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/DebConf9/), hence I did not have
much time in Madrid. I feasted on a quick brunch with an old friend and then I
had to say goodbye outside Atocha station since they do not allow anyone into
the station without a ticket.

Also [Renfe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renfe) operate a security procedure
similar to an Airport. I guess because of the [terrorist
bombings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11_March_2004_Madrid_train_bombings) 5
years earlier. I understand why they do this, but at the same time, no other
train station in Europe does this. So why succumb to foolish fear?

The [Ave](http://www.renfe.es/ave/) trains are **excellent**. David Rogers
caught me boarding the train and I enjoyed the company. Huesca indeed was a
small town, though I found it quite charming with the little Plaza and
what-not. I enjoyed walking around for a change. It was honestly too small for
a bicycle.

Oh and my Spanish from South America came back to me. I felt quite comfortable
reading menus and ordering food and drink. Hotel Abba was quite good and anyway
"hi-ho-hi-ho off to work I go" for the next few days.

The weather and food were good and plentiful. In the afternoon I took some sun
and read "Bad Science" by Ben Goldacre. I felt like I was on holiday. In the
evenings I eventually found quite a cool bar in Huesca that had a pool table
and [table football](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_football).

My first pool game in ages and I came bloody close to a perfect game. Table
football was also most enjoyable. Social activities culminated in a visit to
[Loarre Castle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loarre_Castle) with its stunning
scenery. I had to ask the staff if they had Weddings here and they said yes. I
even went so far to ask how much they cost and the tour guide said all you had
to do is rent the furniture. Wow, how civilised!

Thoughout my time in Huesca, the Spanish guys and a couple of OMTP members
encouraged me to go to Pamplona for the bull run. So on Friday morning at 8am,
I found myself in a street perilously close to a herd of raging bulls.

The
[experience](http://www.rtve.es/mediateca/videos/20090710/peligroso-cuarto-encierro-los-jandilla/541567.shtml)
was quite surreal and happened very quickly. The crowd surged and many people
hurt themselves by just running into each other. I had a run about when they
released the castrated cattle and found a few dazed looks and people being
stretchered off and blood here and there. Carnage basically. They just closed
the gate as I approached and I am thankful I didn't enter that street with the
killer bull "Cappuccino" running amok.

Once returning to my 110EUR hotel room, soaking in the hot tub and somewhat
enjoying the adrenaline come down... I was overcome by how foolish the whole
activity was. I don't recommend it and tbh I never really ever wanted to do
something like this anyway. Damn peer pressure. I've had a few close encounters
with death already and I don't want to push my luck!

I met a few interesting people and after this fantastic week in Spain, I can
relate my experiences to one of my favourite books,
[Fiesta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiesta_%28novel%29).

I tweeted from [beginning](http://twitter.com/kaihendry/status/2481348312) to
[end](http://twitter.com/kaihendry/status/2575177200) whilst out there in
Spain.
