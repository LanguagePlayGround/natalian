Best wishes for your journey dear. I am thinking to attend HAR2009 too but its a bit difficult for me to manage a visit to Netherlands as I have a busy schedule around these dates due to my appointments with some clients to take their requirements of <a href=\"http://www.webdevforums.com\">website design</a>, my part time business. One thing I would like to ask you is what do you mean by LHR in your post. Does it mean Lahore, a city of Pakistan or is it something else?
Looking forward to hear from you.

Alex Fisherr
