I've taken two precious days off on holiday and I've booked my flight to
[Debconf9](http://debconf9.debconf.org/).

I'll arrive late in Madrid at 23 Jul 2009 23:00. Then I hope to stay the night
at a drinking buddy's from my days in Korea. I hope his has [Soju](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soju).

First thing on Friday morning I hope to catch a train to CÃ¡ceres. So I hope to
see some DDs by lunch time.

My plane leaves back to LHR from MAD at 27 Jul 2009 20:50. So I will be leaving
the event at midday on Monday.

PS: I won't be bringing my gun, I'll be bringing my Thinkpad.
