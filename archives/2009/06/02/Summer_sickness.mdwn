Last couple of weeks I've been trying to enjoy summer.

I somehow screwed up my [Brittany Ferries](http://www.brittanyferries.com/)
cabin booking to St-Malo last bank holiday weekend. Hence I had to "sleep" on
deck like a peasant. Next day I fealt like a zombie and my allergies didn't
help.

Since back in England I've somehow contracted a cold, which manifested into an
infected chest. Nonetheless I booked in advance to go to Belgium on the
Eurostar and I kept to the plan.

In Belgium I was feeling a little fragile, but I put down to my allergies. Back
to work on Monday and I enjoyed a gorgeous ride on my Helkama from Woking to
Guildford. Then come lunch time I had stomach ache (perhaps because I skipped
breakfast) and cold sweats.

Left early on Monday to some serious sleeping at home. The doctor seems to
think I have some sort of virus.

I hope it bloody goes away soon. I feel alright for an hour, then I get nauseas
and I feel like I need rest again.

Feel frustrated about how little I'm getting done. This sad little blog post
seems like the best I can muster today on my birthday. :)
