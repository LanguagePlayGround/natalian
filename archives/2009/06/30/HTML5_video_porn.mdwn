[Go get Firefox 3.5](http://getfirefox.com/) and enjoy [HTML5 video](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/video.html)!

I wrote a crappy [script](http://video.natalian.org/my-tube.txt) to generate
the HTML to view those [OGGs I have been
amassing](http://svn.natalian.org/projects/static/prep-videos.sh) from my Canon
IXUS over the years.

I kind of feel I am with video, like I was with pictures & images about 5 years
ago. Pre-[Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/). _You know what I
mean?_ No search, no tags and no friends (filtering dude!).

It would be great if I could point a service like
[Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/) all my OGG paths on
<http://static.natalian.org/>. I am sure as hell not going to upload those
videos with their crappy upload interface.

Gosh, I hope you'll enjoy <http://video.natalian.org> better than [my YouTube
account](http://www.youtube.com/user/kaihendry).

Sadly it's a bit slow from Europe as <http://static.natalian.org/> points to a
server in California. I have a [work server](http://webconverger.org/hetty/)
mirroring the content in Germany. However I am unaware of a [free GEO-DNS
service](http://serverfault.com/questions/30567/geo-dns-providers), are you?
