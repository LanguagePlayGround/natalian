After spending a night in jail in Saint Petersburg after **accidentally**
urinating on the [Bronze
Horseman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Horseman) I learnt one thing very
well.

To get out of jail with no money you can't barter with your shoes, or socks,
trousers, belt or shirt. You need a flashy watch. Thankfully I managed to
upsell my Swatch watch as a bribe to get out of jail. Ever since then I've worn
a flashier Casio G-shock G-510, safe in the knowledge that if I ever went to
jail again, I'd have an easier time convincing my captors that this watch is a
worthy bribe.

However after replacing a [broken
strap](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/4086027840/) in SÃ£o Paulo, later in
my [travels](http://maps.natalian.org/), it broke again recently a few years
later in the UK.

I sent the watch for repair to Casio UK and they said they checked their parts database which includes Germany and Tokyo, and [couldn't find a replacement part](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/4085290333/in/set-72157622635565513/)!!

So if you have a new original G-510 replacement strap, please let me know! It
might be not be as flashy as it was once, though this G-shock has become a
vintage keepsake to me and I don't want to exchange it really.

Otherwise, [Casio have offered me a
discount](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/4085290325/in/set-72157622635565513/)
in exchange on a new watch. I could shoot for a [classic looking
G-shock](http://www.casio.co.uk/products/watches/g-shock/GW-M5600-1ER/At_a_Glance/),
though I should follow my own advice and keep flashy, to keep up with intrepid travel...
