I too have a Casio watch whose wrist-strap keeps breaking. I used to take it to the local jeweller, and they'd order in a strap that looks perfectly generic to me (the only markings I can make out on the part that's left now say \"259 / DK 8 / 20\" I believe, slashes representing line breaks. So chances are there's local dealers that can get you a non-Casio strap. The ones I used to get would break even more easily than the original, though, so I haven't bothered in a while.
