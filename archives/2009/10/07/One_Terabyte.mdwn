[1TB Caviar](http://www.dabs.com/products/western-digital-1tb-caviar-black-7200rpm-32mb-sata-3-5--57Q3.html)
should be [1024 gigabytes](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=1TB+in+GB).

## fdisk

	hendry@i7 ~$ sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdb

	Disk /dev/sdb: 1000.2 GB, 1000204886016 bytes
	255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 121601 cylinders
	Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes
	Disk identifier: 0xdd67f844

	   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
	/dev/sdb1               1      121601   976760001   83  Linux

	hendry@i7 ~$ cat /proc/partitions | grep sdb

	   8       17  976760001 sdb1


## [XFS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfs)

	/dev/sdb1 on /mnt/home type xfs (rw)
	/dev/sdb1             932G  4.2M  932G   1% /mnt/home

Totally gut feeling `iotop -b` with a `sudo rsync -art /home/ /mnt/home/`

	Total DISK READ: 54.97 M/s | Total DISK WRITE: 56.83 M/s

Seemed like it was quite a good rate from the `/dev/sda4 on /home type ext4 (rw)`.

## [reiserfs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reiserfs)

	/dev/sdb1 on /mnt/home type reiserfs (rw)
	/dev/sdb1             932G   33M  932G   1% /mnt/home

	hendry@i7 ~$ iotop -b | grep Total
	Total DISK READ: 9.04 M/s | Total DISK WRITE: 0.00 B/s
	Total DISK READ: 16.22 M/s | Total DISK WRITE: 11.08 M/s
	Total DISK READ: 14.20 M/s | Total DISK WRITE: 9.05 M/s
	Total DISK READ: 14.89 M/s | Total DISK WRITE: 4.66 M/s
	Total DISK READ: 43.21 M/s | Total DISK WRITE: 39.24 M/s
	Total DISK READ: 31.01 M/s | Total DISK WRITE: 1994.15 K/s

## [ext3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext3)

	/dev/sdb1 on /mnt/home type ext3 (rw)
	/dev/sdb1             917G  200M  871G   1% /mnt/home

Quite a stable:

	Total DISK READ: 48.16 M/s | Total DISK WRITE: 45.55 M/s

## [ext4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext4)

	/dev/sdb1 on /mnt/home type ext4 (rw)
	/dev/sdb1             917G  200M  871G   1% /mnt/home

Maybe better performance than ext3.

	Total DISK READ: 56.90 M/s | Total DISK WRITE: 56.94 M/s


## Funny notes

Surprisingly `sudo cp -r /home/ /mnt/home/` seemed slower than `sudo rsync -art
/home/ /mnt/home/`. Wtf is up with that?

I just took a random `iotop` reading which I thought was representative of the transfer rates I was seeing.

For more details on the hardware please view [[archives/2009/09/06/linux_i7_rig]].

What was my final choice? **xfs**
