I previously [[pleaded_for_a_solution|archives/2009/02/03/dabase-is-the-place-to-be]] to help import my
Wordpress posts to
[Ikiwiki](http://ikiwiki.info/tips/Importing_posts_from_Wordpress/).

I've now done it myself with the help of [lxml](http://codespeak.net/lxml/) and
[lamby's start](http://chris-lamb.co.uk/projects/ikiwiki-wordpress-import/) on
the problem.

I'm not entirely sure if I've used lxml correctly. I use it in a SAXy [serial
access](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_access) way when I guess I could
have just pulled from the
[DOM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) tree. I've used the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language)">textile markup
language</a> on my previous Wordpress blog. Hence I've run all my posts through
a textile filter and dumped the resulting HTML into .mdwn files.

So if you look through Natalian's [[archives]], you'll see this blog stretches
back now more than 6 years to 2003-04-27. That's a **long time** for a blog and
the link rot shows.

For example I used to host pictures on **pictures.natalian.org** and referenced
them in my blogs:

	hendry@x61 archives$ grep -r pictures.natalian.org * | wc -l
	94

That service does not exist anymore, since my my pictures are now all on
[Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/) and
<http://static.natalian.org/>.

There is still some issues I need to resolve, such as [[tags|archives/tag]]. One
has to manually create the tags files which is a major PITA.

So far I like where I am now with Ikiwiki.info. Though I am keen to possibly
try a [suckless](http://suckless.org) approach with [werc](http://werc.cat-v.org/).
