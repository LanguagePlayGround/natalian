I want to scan all my family's paper photographs, so that our memories can be
saved digitally for my family heritage.

It's 2009 and I don't think people understand that if well kept, digital
history can survive perfectly intact for thousands of years! We are on the cusp of a new age of detailed digitally stored history.

My [local photography shop in Woking](http://www.harpersphoto.co.uk/), which
are usually rather good, charge 10GBP to scan 25 pictures to a CD.

After some investigation of scanners, the [Fujitsu ScanSnap S300M](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwVzyhocVig) caught my eye.

After contacting Fujitsu UK, the Fujitsu FI-6230 scanner seems like the right
kit to scan all my family photographs over Christmas. Unfortunately the device
does not scan conveniently to SD media without a computer and seems to require
a computer running Windows software. :( Also the device is not available for
rent, so the only option seems to purchase the device.

<http://www.kgsltd.org/> has quoted me 845.25GBP for the device.

For a week's use, this seems quite expensive. I am not sure about the reselling
market, so you think I could sell this nearly device as take a 10% hit?

Does [anyone else out there have the same scanning of old paper photos
problem](http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2006/04/did_i_dream_this_photo_scanner/)
and is willing to purchase it from me afterwards?

I am thinking if my father is keen, he could probably start a company scanning
in paper photographs for other people. I have not been able to find any
suitable service in the UK. Have you?

Ideally I could just send in the shoe boxes of pictures in stages and the
scanning service uploads "post-processed" images straight to my [static Web
host](http://static.natalian.org/) via rsync.
