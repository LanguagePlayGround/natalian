When you say paper, you mean print photos on photo paper, right? Do I gather from your words that you intend to feed those through the ADF?

I did a lot of photo digitisation from print photos using your average flatbed consumer scanners in my day. My current scanner is a higher-end Epson GT2500 which, however, I purchased as a b/w text document digitisation tool, mostly using the automated document feeder. I have always found all scanning of photographs on all hardware extremely frustrating because of the amount of noise (dust) gathering on the glass and the image. The pros presumably have a rinsing procedure of sorts that you'll want to familiarise yourself with. Also, getting the colour balance right can be tricky, but that's true of all colour scanning.

The alternative is using a negative scanner, but only if your folks have kept their negatives. A good negative scanner is dead expensive, but you might be able to rent one. Here too, there can be complications: whenever I've had photo-shops scan my (brand new) negatives, it's yielded very grainy images, though a photographer once assured me a good negative scanner will do a good job. The best digitisation results I've seen came from a photo-shop that would print my negatives, then scan from the print.

If you can scan all your family print photos in a week, then your folks haven't gathered nearly as much material as mine. Unless you were indeed intending to use the ADF, in which case I'll be interested to hear about your experiences--I've never tried but I'm sceptical, especially when using dog-eared shoe-box material: I fear for misfeeding and consequent damaging of your print photos. This machine's ADF specs look pretty good, though. Is there a physical shop somewhere where they'd let you try scanning a few photographs as a test?
