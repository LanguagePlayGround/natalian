<p>That&#8217;s not really the point. Orange could have create a domain for this but have decided upon an approach popular in Japan. Users often search for a site even if they know the <span class="caps">URL</span>, they even put &#8216;www.google.com&#8217; into google. It might not be to everyone&#8217;s tastes, but their was thought behind the idea.</p>
