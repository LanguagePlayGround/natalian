<p>Great post!<br />
I never heard of the Cornish Riviera, let alone the Cornish Riviera Express. Sounds far too exotic for Cornwall. All the same, my folks went cycling in Cornwall a few years ago and loved it.<br />
Did a search on Wikipedia and found lots of other rivieras, including the Redneck Riviera (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redneck_Riviera">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redneck_Riviera</a>)!!! <br />
I&#8217;ve just finished reading The Great Railway Bazaar by Paul Theroux, a journey by train from London to Tokyo and back in the 70s. Great read.</p>
