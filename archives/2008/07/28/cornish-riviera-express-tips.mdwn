<p>Booking a ticket in advance is advisable during busy periods, though the <a href="http://www.firstgreatwestern.co.uk/">First Great Western</a> website is <strong>terrible</strong>. Singles are often expensive and you need to seek out &#8220;super saver return&#8221; tickets under a hidden &#8220;more flexible options&#8221; button. Even then you are not guaranteed a seat when collecting your tickets. :(</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t book, you can get a seat if you stand in the right place at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddington_train_station">Paddington train station</a>. Stand as close as possible to the platforms whilst keeping on an eye on the announcement boards. With experience you can sniff out the train and once announced <strong>dash</strong> for coach C or D, the unreserved coach.</p>

<p>When busy (i.e. Friday evenings), some seats generally only free up around the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_Abbot">Newton Abbot</a> stop, so prepare to wait standing (hours) till then if you didn&#8217;t grab a seat. So catching the Express from Reading station without a booked seat is silly. Catching the Express from Exeter St. Davids (perhaps you came via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westbury_railway_station">Westbury</a>) means usually just standing for one stop on the Express on a busy evening. Not bad.</p>

<p>After Newton Abbot the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornish_Riviera_Express">Riviera Express</a> is really stunning. The sea a stone throw away&#8230; and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamar_Bridge">Tamar bridge</a>. It&#8217;s an incredible train journey&#8230; back home to <a href="http://prazefarm.co.uk/">Praze Farm</a> at <a href="http://flickr.com/search/?q=bodmin%20parkway">Bodmin Parkway</a>, my favourite train station. The station is within walking distance of the fabulous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanhydrock"">Lanhydrock estate</a>.</p>

<p>When travelling weekends upgrade to <strong>first class for 10GBP</strong>. Highly recommended except beware of their silly <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/hendry/2710696024/">positioning of the plugs</a>. The <a href="http://natalian.org/archives/2007/06/08/new-style-penzance-trains/">power plug outlets are better in coach/second class</a>.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/2278783255/">3G internet on the train</a> is sporadic, though it's not too bad. I usually manage to do some work on a Sunday evening, back to the big smoke for work on Monday morning.
