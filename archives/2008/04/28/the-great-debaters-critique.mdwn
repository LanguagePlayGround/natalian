<p>Last night I watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427309/">The Great Debaters</a> and I have a few problems with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Debaters">movie</a>.</p>

<p>For me the skill and fun in debating is to:</p>

<ul>
<li>not prepare speeches (more than say 10 minutes in advance)</li>
<li>to analyse the key arguments from both sides</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the most satisfying debates is when I would have to argue for something I loathe, like patents. In the movie, besides the &#8220;welfare&#8221; speech, I didn&#8217;t see the emphasis on the great debating skill of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devils_advocate">playing devil&#8217;s advocate</a>.</p>

<p>The movie didn&#8217;t really detail how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Parliamentary_Style">debating works</a>. I recall there being just one reference to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy">fallacy</a> in the film. This could have been explored far better by the writers, instead of a dull love triangle.</p>

<p>The affirmative = proposition and the negative = opposition. Grrr&#8230;</p>

<p>There was too much emphasis on dates, fact &amp; figures, references and statistics. Any good debater knows to stay clear of that. Quotes (just one for me) are OK, but not to base a speech around!</p>

<p>The movie actually raises the age old classic example of Ghandi and his peaceful protest. I love to rip that argument to pieces, as a good counter-argument was the British Empire was too weak from the World War to hold onto India.</p>

<p>The big speeches in the movie were sadly generally emotive ones and played to their parts or rather to the the colour of their skin.</p>
