<p>It&#8217;s funny how people decide and rule on <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7340101.stm">such things</a>.</p>

<p>I heard on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/">radio</a> this morning that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7340155.stm">Adidas won a long running court case against a competitor who was using two stripes</a>. Adidas fealt that it &#8220;prevented&#8221; (their own words) the use of their &#8220;Intellectual Property&#8221; of three stripes.</p>

<p>Yes, W.T.F. !</p>

<p>I want to fight this silly regulation. I wonder how best to go about fixing Intellectual Property laws. I&#8217;m particularly dismayed <span class="caps">WRT</span> software patents in the EU. However I can&#8217;t decide which organisation would be the most effective conduit of my time:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/"><span class="caps">ORG</span></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.eff.org/">eff.org</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ffii.org/">ffii.org</a></li>
<li><a href="http://fsfe.org/">fsfe.org</a></li>
<li>And even <a href="http://www.ukuug.org/"><span class="caps">UKUUG</span></a> are active in such areas</li>
</ul>
