<p>After <a href="http://www.geekyoto.com/">Geekyoto</a> I was trying to figure out how much I spend on electricity. I believe people will change their habits once they <strong>know the cost</strong>.</p>

<p>Then after receiving <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/2508376346/in/set-72157605153273216/">my electricity bill</a> I couldn&#8217;t actually work out how much my &#8216;50W spot light&#8217; costs me a day in electricity!</p>

<p>The first problem is that I paid my bill with a <strong>fixed direct debit</strong>. So I really had no idea how much electricity I was really spending per month. I called up and changed that to <strong>variable direct debit</strong>.</p>

<p>The next problem I had, was understanding the notion of <strong>standard energy unit</strong> and <strong>discounted energy unit</strong> blocks. I won&#8217;t go into this as it is quite <strong>complex</strong>. Call up your supplier to give you a simpler fixed unit price which is somewhere in the middle. With a fixed price you now have a chance to calculate out your <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/2536302168/in/set-72157605153273216/">electricity cost</a>.</p>
