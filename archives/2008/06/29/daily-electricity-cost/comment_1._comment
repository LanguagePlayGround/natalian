he cost of electricity depends on where you live, how much you use, and possibly when you use it. There are also fixed <a href=\"http://www.fortuneave.com/mortgage-rates.html\">mortgage rates</a> that you pay every month no matter how much electricity you use. For example, I pay $6/mo. for the privilege of being a customer of the electric company, no matter how much energy I use.
