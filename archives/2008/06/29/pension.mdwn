<p>I&#8217;ve long been annoyed by large corporates, hedge funds and investment bankers. I believe in a world of small businesses and this is why I&#8217;ve already invested a large proportion of my efforts in Free software &amp; the (open) Web.</p>

<p>However it comes to a point in one&#8217;s life (I&#8217;m 30 now) where one needs to aggressively save money. Save for a car, save for a house, save for the future. In England tax-free cash ISAs are just 3600GBP a year. That sum makes it very difficult to get a mortgage for a house in England. Though, the UK government also offers tax-free share based <span class="caps">ISA</span> savings.</p>

<p>That means you need to invest in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_limited_company">public limited company</a> on the <a href="http://finance.google.co.uk/finance">stock exchange</a>. I.e. you need to give your money to those &#8220;large corporates, hedge funds and investment bankers&#8221;. Not cool.</p>

<p>Recently the company <a href="http://hendry.iki.fi/cv/">I work for</a> set me up with a <a href="http://www.scottishwidows.co.uk/">Scottish Widows plan</a>. Personally I&#8217;d rather have the extra money, but once again the powers that be force me to put some of my money into &#8220;large corporates, hedge funds and investment bankers&#8221;. Grumble.</p>

<p>Scottish Widows however does allow you to make (token) choices. You have very little to go on, except for the name of the funds. You really haven&#8217;t got a clue where the money goes. :(</p>

<p>I chose the following funds with the advice from my pension adviser:<br />
* Property 15%<br />
* European 15%<br />
* SW Newton Managed 20%<br />
* SW MM UK Eq Growth 10%<br />
* Corporate bond 15%<br />
* Fixed Interest 10%<br />
* SW Art UK Sm Cos 15%</p>

<p>I tried to invest in EU small businesses, as I believe in a strong <strong>economic European union</strong>. I wanted to invest mostly in <strong>property</strong> as I argued to myself that property would be safe, low risk, long term and didn&#8217;t involve the short term interests of &#8220;large corporates, hedge funds and investment bankers&#8221;.</p>

<p>Unfortunately 15% is the maximum you can spend in property.</p>

<p>My dad later commented that investing in typical pension property schemes like shopping centres isn&#8217;t going to work with &#8220;E-commerce&#8221;. That had me again about the future. Where natural resources &amp; food will probably rise and travelling gets harder and the Web&#8217;s reach will probably span wider.</p>

<p>Now I can understand how those <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capitalists">VCs</a> at <a href="http://openbusiness.cc/">Minibar London</a> get all their money!</p>

<p>Ideally I could take that share <span class="caps">ISA</span> allocation and the money going into that aforementioned pension plan and put it into my own <a href="http://webconverger.com/">Web kiosk company</a>. It might be risky, but I think it has a good future and a future I can control. That&#8217;s piece of mind for my principles and beliefs.</p>
