<p>Some advice I&#8217;ve randomly found from my <a href="http://maps.natalian.org/">travel</a> diaries. Badly translated from Russian:</p>

<ol>
<li>Be like a &#8220;King Arthur&#8221;.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t drink too much in places you don&#8217;t know.</li>
<li>Have a good guide who knows which company you should spend your time with.</li>
<li>Guide must be a man. Man knows girls.</li>
</ol>

<p>Also I learnt one should never mix sheep fat and cold water.</p>
