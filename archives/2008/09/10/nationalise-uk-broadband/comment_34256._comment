<p>hi Kai,watched so man</p>

<p>great post. This is being discussed on Radio 5 just now &#8211; give them a call I reckon and put a rational input to the debate! How come it needs to cost so much &#8211; like you say other countries done it at a fraction of the cost! I reckon outource it to India :)</p>

<p>I used to stay in Oulu, Finland and my hall of residence there we had gigabit connection from one house (back in 2002)&#8212;never been to so many movie parties in my life :)</p>
