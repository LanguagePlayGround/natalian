<p>Sorry Hendry but your misinformation needs correcting&#8230;</p>

<p>&gt; Basic <span class="caps">HTML</span> works on most phones with a browser Alex.<br />
Not true. Lots of little gotchas out there, that need device specific adaptations. Therefore the <span class="caps">WURFL</span> powered <span class="caps">WALL</span>, or possibly Haw Haw (tho I don&#8217;t know how device-specific it is) is the only way.</p>

<p>&gt; Unless perhaps you unfairly include <span class="caps">WAP</span> phones.<br />
Countless millions of people (e.g. in developing countries) still have <span class="caps">WAP</span>-only phones. Personally I don&#8217;t want to exclude them from using my apps. Indeed, I am making apps that are specifically targeted toward them. I personally think the Web should be an inclusive place, and not only be for the subset of richer folk that have access to phones with <span class="caps">XHTML</span> browsers.</p>

<p>&gt; You can use advanced features like Javascript in advanced phones. Then you must make sure your application is usable without Javascript enabled.<br />
Yes. So what? No big deal, esp. with <span class="caps">WALL</span>&#8216;s assistance. Any half decent programmer/designer should be able to do this.</p>

<p>&gt; If you are determined to throw money and resources to eeek out small &amp; temporary amounts of “user experience” then use <span class="caps">WURFL</span><br />
<span class="caps">WURFL</span>/WALL are free, easy to use, and run on most server/shared server plans. Hence why they are the de facto industry standard the world over. Using them has meant potentially reaching very many more users in the world (technically hundreds of millions) vs. them not being able to access the app at all (a slightly larger effect than small I think most would agree).</p>

<p>&gt; Reason why I say “temporary” is that these approaches &amp; techniques quickly become out of date and fragmented themselves.<br />
Nonsense. <span class="caps">WURFL</span>/WALL beats fragmentation, that&#8217;s the whole point of it. As for temporary, a 2-minute periodic update to the device database (free also) with the latest updates means I consider it a permanent, not temporary solution.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
