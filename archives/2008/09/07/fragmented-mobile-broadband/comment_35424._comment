<p>The same stupid strategy, as in Germany. I have to pay 30 €/month for my voice flat (landline, and t-mobile + sms-flat) and sim, and also 40€ a month for my real unlimited <span class="caps">HSDPA</span> access with my Huawei express card and a second sim. 2 different contracts, 2 different cards&#8230; why ?</p>
