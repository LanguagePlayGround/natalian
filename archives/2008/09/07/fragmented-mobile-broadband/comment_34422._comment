<p>I will not believe that they can detect the type of device you are using until I see it. I wanted to ask you how easy it might be to clone a <span class="caps">SIM</span> card so that you could have one in your phone and one in your modem. Though if you tried to use both at the same time they really might get suspicious.</p>
