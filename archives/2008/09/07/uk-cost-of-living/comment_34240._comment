<p>I&#8217;m currently taking the day-by-day approach to living expenses. As a well-below-the-poverty-line PhD student, I am tweaking my diet to find the cheapest lifestyle possible in my neighbourhood, which so far relies heavily on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honest_Ed" rel="nofollow">Honest Ed&#8217;s</a> and a Korean greengrocer. After the first week, I&#8217;ve got it down to an average of $CDN 4 to 4.50 per day, which is pretty impressive. I do wonder whether my recent drowsiness is diet-related. And I don&#8217;t know how much longer I&#8217;ll be able to stand the noodles and processed bread.</p>

<p>Getting a cheaper room would cut expenses considerably, but I don&#8217;t want to risk losing a pleasant living environment.</p>
