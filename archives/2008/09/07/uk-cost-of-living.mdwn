<p>After taking over a two bedroom <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraced_house">terraced house</a> in <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/hendry/tags/woking/">Woking</a>, I have been taking full responsibility of the bills.</p>

<p>Since I sublet to a house mate I&#8217;ve been <a href="http://natalian.org/archives/2008/06/29/daily-electricity-cost/">trying to work out how much living costs are</a>, in order to fairly split the bill between us.</p>

<p>I have the bigger room, so that&#8217;s my little reward for this painstaking research.</p>

<p>Rent is 800GBP a month, which isn&#8217;t bad for Woking, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey">Surrey</a>. The location is good for commuting to London Waterloo in about 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Electricity is roughly 30GBP a month. Due to rise 19% this year.</p>

<p>Gas is 40GBP a month. Due to rise 29% this year.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/2800295546/" title="August Gas bill by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3053/2800295546_1436af927e_m.jpg" width="170" height="240" alt="August Gas bill" /></a>

<p>I have not switched my water bill to variable direct debit, but judging by the low credit on my account, I would say the regular payments of 23GBP suffice.</p>

<a href="http://webconverger.org/blog/entry/UK_Internet/">Discounted cable broadband (XL)</a> costs 29GBP a month. I have no landline telephone, so I don't pay <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_telecom">BT</a> tax. I also do not have a TV, so I do not pay for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_licensing_in_the_United_Kingdom">TV license</a>, though do I use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_iPlayer">BBC iplayer</a> frequently.

<a href="http://www.woking.gov.uk/benefits/CTax2008">Woking band C</a> (bands are bizarre) is 1200GBP a year, so 100GBP a month.

<p>Admittedly I pay 10GBP an hour for a cleaner to come in two hours a week. This is not really enough time to clean this house, so of course my housemate and I have to do our own laundry and odd jobs like clean windows etc.</p>

<p>So in total: 800 (Rent) + 30 (Electricity) + 40 (Gas) + 23 (Water) + 29 (Internet) + 100 (Council tax) + 80 (cleaner) = 1102 <span class="caps">GBP</span></p>

<p>This rise in fuel bills will only probably increase Gas &amp; Electric (fuel) bills a maximum of 20GBP a month, which is not too much. Finally say 1120GBP shared between two people is, 560GBP a month.</p>

<p>I would describe my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_living">standard of living</a> as pretty basic. The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7513843.stm">weather is terrible</a>. There is not much space. Heating insulation isn&#8217;t very good, though I do have a small garden. Unfortunately having a garden does present a maintenance cost that I have not factored in.</p>

<p>Incidentally I recommend opening a second current account if you are also intent on working out how much you spend a month on living costs.</p>

<p>Next I&#8217;ll try work out how much I spend on food and toiletries.</p>
