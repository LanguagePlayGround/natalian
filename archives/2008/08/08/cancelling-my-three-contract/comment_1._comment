I renewed my 18 contract with 3 0n 31st Oct this year. I have two phones (one is my husband's but is in my name) and they're both on different tariffs. I want to now downgrade my tariff to the same as my husband's but have been told I can't.

I can upgrade and pay more money but can't downgrade and pay less money-rather unsurprisingly.

Is there not a legal statement where you have a 28 day cooling off period when you take sign contracts, etc? Does this apply to a mobile phone company?

Any help greatly appreciated
