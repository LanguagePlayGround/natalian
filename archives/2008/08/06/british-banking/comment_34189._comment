<p>@Jamie: I&#8217;m trying to do two things. Raise awareness that UK banking service industry is in fact, crap. Second, write to the &#8220;higher powers&#8221;. Would you rather me use <span class="caps">VISA</span>, paypal and the like because banks are too greedy &amp; stupid? <span class="caps">VISA</span> already has too much power. I&#8217;m afraid banks have to be dragged kicking and screaming to the competitive world, be regulation.</p>

<p>@Adamski: Last time I sent Kruger coins to fund your medical degree through the post they mysteriously vanished. ;)</p>

<p>@Joose: Does Finland/Nordea support some really easy to use checkout system like Google? I would move my operations to Finland, but then again I am petrified of the high taxes.</p>

<p>Why can&#8217;t I operate from some little Caribbean Islands like most shipping companies seem to do&#8230;?</p>
