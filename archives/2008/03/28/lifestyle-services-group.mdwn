<p>The autonomy of a disaster. My camera slipped through my gloves on a cold day in Washington DC. The &#8220;Lifestyle Services Group&#8221; provides &#8220;gadget cover&#8221; if you have the account extra &#8220;Barclays First Additions&#8221; (6.50GBP extra a month).</p>

<ol>
<li>24/2 Dropped my camera in Washington DC</li>
<li>25/2 Called <span class="caps">LSG</span> to report the incident</li>
<li>26/2 Form arrives from <span class="caps">LSG</span> that needs my signature and payment details for the 25GBP excess</li>
<li>27/2 Form sent</li>
<li>29/2 Called <span class="caps">LSG</span> for an update</li>
<li>5/3 Called again as I <em>need a camera</em> for travelling on the 13/3. Since they seem to be taking so long I order the the same camera from Amazon as a replacement. Of course I tell <span class="caps">LSG</span> I am buying a replacement beforehand, but they don&#8217;t want to hear of it.</li>
<li>5/3 I notice that 25GBP is taken from my account. Maybe something is happening?</li>
<li>5/3 When I get home from work I notice a letter (dated 3/3) with an address I should send my broken <span class="caps">IXUS</span> 950IS to</li>
<li>6/3 Posted camera according to instructions. Registered and priority&#8230;</li>
<li>7/3 Called to confirm they have the broken camera</li>
<li>11/3 replacement camera arrives</li>
<li>11/3 Called <span class="caps">LSG</span>, couldn&#8217;t get through :(</li>
<li>11/3 Come home to find a claim for like that from #3. <span class="caps">WTF</span>?</li>
<li>11/3 get a call at 5pm offering a cash settlement of what I paid for the camera in the first place.</li>
</ol>

<p>So 17 days later, 25GBP excess + call costs + postage&amp;packaging, several phone calls, some running around and a lot of trauma I get an Insurance claim through. Wow, a victory for the small guy.</p>

<p>Some notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it just my impression that Insurance companies like <span class="caps">LSG</span> seem to go out their way to provide poor customer service to the point that you the customer just want to give up?</li>
<li>I was actually also covered by <a href="http://www.columbusdirect.com/">Columbus travel insurance</a>. I am not going to waste money on Columbus as I was unable to file a claim with them. After chasing up with them, they said they would send a form (via a third party) which never arrived.</li>
<li>#6 My <span class="caps">IXUS</span> 950IS was actually more expensive that what I originally paid for it. So I think when <span class="caps">LSG</span> called up on #13 they were happy to pay the lesser price.</li>
<li>I primarily took this insurance policy for my mobile. But can you imagine waiting at least 17 days to get a mobile phone replacement? I can&#8217;t!</li>
<li>Why didn&#8217;t <span class="caps">LSG</span> take the payment details for the excess over the phone in #2?</li>
<li>Why didn&#8217;t <span class="caps">LSG</span> tell me the address to ship my broken camera at stage #2? It took them 11 days to tell me. They could have just told me over the phone.</li>
<li>Since I received the new camera in #11 and even though I <strong>told <span class="caps">LSG</span> repeatedly</strong> about that, I was surprised they never asked to take new serial number down. I had to call them up again to &#8220;register the details of my new camera&#8221;. Poor customer service.</li>
<li>Why don&#8217;t Insurance companies use email?</li>
<li>All this time&#8230; over what? a 180GBP camera? Insurance delays and what not. Is it really worth it?</li>
</ul>
