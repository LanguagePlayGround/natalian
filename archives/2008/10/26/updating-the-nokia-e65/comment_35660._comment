<p>&gt; I wish I could buy mobile devices outright at a reasonable price</p>

<p>Depends what you mean by &#8220;reasonable&#8221; I suppose. I think you mean &#8220;cheap&#8221; :) Quite a lot of handsets you can buy and own, rather than subsidise with a contract, even the iPhone is now on <span class="caps">PAYG</span>, and the current object of my gadget lust, the <span class="caps">HTC</span> Touch HD, I should be able to buy outright, unlocked, though not cheap.</p>

<p>Incidentally, talking of S60 handsets, El Reg seemed to love the <a href="http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2008/10/25/review_mobile_phone_samsung_i8510/" rel="nofollow">i8510</a>, I might take a look.</p>
