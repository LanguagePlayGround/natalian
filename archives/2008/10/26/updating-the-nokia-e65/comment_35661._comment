<p>&gt; I wish I could buy mobile devices outright at a reasonable price</p>

<p>You should come back to finland =) 3g is starting from 9,90e/month without any long contracts, no prepaid 3g afaik though :( And you can buy every phone (except iPhone 3g) without contracts. Although, you can go and buy iphone 3g from few countries without contract with the operator.</p>

<p>I just bought a simple mobile and a sim-card: 39e for the phone and 0,66e/month + 0,069e/min for the sim-card and I can end contract when ever I want.</p>
