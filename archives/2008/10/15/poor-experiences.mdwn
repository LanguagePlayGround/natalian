<p>To write about something one should have experienced it. Have I experienced poverty?</p>

<p>I like to think I have at two times of my life.</p>

<p>After 6th form when I helped my parents settle in Cornwall. I had no money. I ate, though I seriously had <strong>no money</strong> and I was living on a farm with no petrol in the car. I would be feeling uneasy for weeks about the 20 <span class="caps">GBP</span> I was overdrawn. What a waste whilst 19 years old. Trapped.</p>

<p>Couple of years ago I traveled in India for several months. I saw poverty everyday and I was fascinated by it. It became some sort of entertainment for me. Observing how people live with so little resources. I was living cheaply on as little as 10USD a day. Still at least 10 times better than a lot of locals.</p>

<p>Lessons learned? Money is freedom.</p>
