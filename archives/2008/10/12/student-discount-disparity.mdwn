<p>A couple of German friends visited me in the UK last week who are <strong>students</strong>.</p>

<p>Most museums in London are free for both adults and students. Great. Though why not charge working adults and not students, like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitage_Museum">Hermitage</a> does?</p>

<p>Outside London, things get weird.</p>

<p>Many churches such as Salisbury and Bath Abbey ask for a &#8220;donation&#8221;. That&#8217;s a good model for me, as I have no scruples about that sort of thing.</p>

<p>Attractions like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Baths_(Bath)">Baths</a> charge an outrageous 12 <span class="caps">GBP</span> for Adults and 10GBP for students. <span class="caps">WTF</span>? The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermae_Bath_Spa">Bath Baths</a> you can actually bathe in, also has a ridiculous <a href="http://www.thermaebathspa.com/treatments/spasessions/">student pricing model</a>. 22GBP full price and 18GBP for students.</p>

<p>Since when do students typically earn 20% less than full time workers?</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.edenproject.com/plan-your-visit/prices/index.php">Eden project charge</a> 15GBP for adults and 7GBP for students. So this project thinks students earn about 50% less than a worker (which might be true in Cornwall ;).</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep you eyes peeled for this disparity and report here if you can. I think I might <a href="http://www.writetothem.com/">write a letter to my MP</a> about this. He hasn&#8217;t heard from me in awhile.</p>
