<p>Is <a href="http://static.natalian.org/2008-11-27/facebook-lost.txt">this</a> for real?</p>

<p>I am definitely closing my Facebook account. Just <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/dataportability-public/browse_thread/thread/0efdcbcdca47728a#">desperately trying to figure out</a> how to keep in contact with my friends.</p>

<p>I guess if friends want to find me, they will just search for my name &#8220;Kai Hendry&#8221;. If they can&#8217;t figure that out, then&#8230; do I want to be friends with them? ;)</p>
