<p>Rang up Vodafone UK to be sure. She was not sure how much it was per megabyte(!). Eventually she said she &#8220;thinks it&#8217;s 2.50GBP per megabyte&#8221;.</p>

<p>Of course she recommended the 7.50GBP Web &#8220;bolt on&#8221;. So that&#8217;s 27.50GBP a month for the &#8216;fair&#8217; usage of 500M per month.</p>

<p>I think the mobile Web will have a hard time to prosper with these current super offers.</p>
