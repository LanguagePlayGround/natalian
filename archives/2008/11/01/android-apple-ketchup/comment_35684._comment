<p><span class="caps">FWIW</span>, I&#8217;m having quite a positive experience with my T1 in the UK.  I could go down your list and explain why many of these issues aren&#8217;t a problem for me, but that wouldn&#8217;t be particularly helpful.</p>

<p>I agree with your point from another post about how poor the PR has been.  Just a few bus stop posters.  In fact, the first I&#8217;d even heard of the phone was when Eric Raymond got one.  Luckily I managed to get my phone on day 1 by going to my local T-Mobile shop before work.</p>

<p>First thing this morning I got a firmware update.  Presumably this fixes the exaggerated bug.</p>
