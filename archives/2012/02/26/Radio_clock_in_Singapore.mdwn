When reaching the summit of Mount Kinabalu in the early morning after spending
almost 2 months in Kuala Lumpur without a time update to my [Casio GW-M5600-1ER wrist watch](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/4124170111/), I was
surprised to see it time syncing.

This made my think that perhaps [Radio
clock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_clock) works better, the higher you
are.  4095.2m in that case.

After moving to Singapore, again my clock failed to sync during the night until
I (like the directions suggest) took off my watch one night and left it on the
window sill. It synced at 2012-02-22T03:04+08:00 in the Mount Sophia area of
Singapore.

So **yes** you can pick up [low frequency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_frequency) time signals in Singapore!

However it must be patchy since I visited a Casio G-shock store in [Harbour Front](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HarbourFront)
and enquired about their Radio clock range. They don't sell any Radio clock
products!
