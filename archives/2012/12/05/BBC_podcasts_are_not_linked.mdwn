I love the BBC output but I'm annoyed how difficult it is to share their content, previously:

* [[archives/2012/07/15/BBC_FOOC_URLs_make_no_sense]]
* [[archives/2012/08/20/BBC_URLs_are_not_cool]]

I love the [BBC Witness series](http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/witness)
which has the same problems as <abbr title="From Our Own
Correspondent">FOOC</abbr> when it comes to their [[URLs|archives/2012/08/20/BBC_URLs_are_not_cool]].

When listening to the Witness podcast using Apple's Podcasts App, if I email the, the body of the email looks like:

	Check out this great Podcast: http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/worldservice/witness/rss.xml

* It links to the RSS which is useless to most people
* It doesn't link to what I'm actually listening to

The popular "Pocket Cast Lite", when sharing the Podcast it emails look like:

	Podcast: Witness
	Episode: Witness: The Bhopal disaster

	Find out more about the podcast at:

Their [linked URL](http://www.pocketcasts.com/share/Ofzlnt) does not point to
the relevant BBC page <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0112t3d> about the
Podcast I'm listening to.

Come on BBC. Please fix this!
