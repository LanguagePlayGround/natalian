# Online banking sucks

It's like banking in Europe 10 years ago. Think Internet Explorer. Think
Javascript scripts timing out. Think Java. Think no way to report bugs. Think
no acknowledgement of reported bugs. Think if they ever roll out an update to
fix your issue, they break something else. True story.

I'm thinking of starting a blog highlighting the hilariously bad engineering
going into Singapore made banking Web applications.

# No super convenient ATM network

You have to learn where your bank's ATMs are to avoid charges. Good luck!

# Domestic transfers take THREE DAYS

Transfer done before 12pm on day 1 will arrive either by 6pm on day 2 or 1pm on
day 3. That's the one that costs no money. If you want a domestic same day
transfer it costs $20 per transfer.

It's like going back to the 90s in the UK. Without the 20SGD charge.

# Using a debit card? That's 10% thanks!

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/8237486310/" title="1.34SGD for paying by direct debit WTF??!? by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8210/8237486310_3c8c5b0d7a_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="1.34SGD for paying by direct debit WTF??!?"></a>

There is a **charge** for using you card. For example it can be charged 10% if you hand over your card to the taxi driver.

One way to lessen the charge is to ask to pay by
[NETS](http://www.nets.com.sg/), whereby you are only charged 30 cents. Compare
that to Europe where debit cards incur no costs, so don't make assumptions.

Evidently merchants are confused whether you want to be charged by the more
expensive direct debit or NETS. Ask for NETS, then the merchant will probably
demand cash since remember it takes **3 days** for them to get their money from
[NETS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_for_Electronic_Transfers).

# Confusion over bank codes

You might get a Bank code number like 7144 and a Branch code number like 057.
These are used in transfers between Singapore and Malaysia typically.

Nonetheless the term **Bank code** is interchangeable with the SWIFT code,
leading to a lot of confusion. Good luck paying your bills!

# Don't change your mobile number

If you change your [number in
Singapore](http://natalian.org/archives/2012/11/29/Singapore_telecommunications/)
you might be in for a shock. Most security is tied to your telephone number and
you have to at the very least go to a branch to get your number changed.

If you are abroad, you might have to do what I did. Email. Email again.  Write a letter. Wait a
month. Have bank staff tell your number is updated and still see the old number in
the system. Go crazy. Go back to Singapore to go to a branch to update the
number. Surprise!

# Paypal UK != Paypal SG

That goes for banks too. If you think it's easier to move money around because
you have a account with the same company in your country, don't.

For example if I want to move <a href="http://webconverger.com/">my
company's</a> subscribers to Singapore and I have to get each one to re-setup
in Singapore. Ha ha ha, oh god no.
