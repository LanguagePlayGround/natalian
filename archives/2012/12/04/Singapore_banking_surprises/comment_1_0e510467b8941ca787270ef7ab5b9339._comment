It's only *very* recently that bank transfers in the UK have become faster than three days, I'm talking like this year.

There is an argument I've heard that says that in the UK we fool ourselves into thinking that banking should be free. And once we think that it's free no one is going to pay for it. Which is why we end up with such huge charges for going overdrawn etc. You don't mention how much this costs in Singapore, maybe less? For example, ATMs, you think that banks can offer that service for nothing? Maybe in Singapore the charges are just more honest, you actually get charged for what costs the bank money.
