[[!meta title="BBC From Our Own Correspondent URLs make no sense"]]

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/7573465582/" title="Sorry there are no matches for BBC FOOC by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8155/7573465582_2296d3ec17_n.jpg" width="320" height="220" alt="Sorry there are no matches for BBC FOOC"></a>

The BBC Web team are guilty of creating meaningless URLs for resources and
making it near impossible to find BBC output. It took me more than an hour to
find a [comprehensive list of BBC FOOC
episodes](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qjlq/episodes/player).

For example the URL for From Our Own Correspondent from 2012-07-07 is:

<http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01kjgp3>

Does **b01kjgp3** make any sense to you for this BBC FOOC instalment?

It gets worse if you want to link to the individual dispatch, for example if
you want to share it with a friend:

* Chapter 1: <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01kjgp3#p00vw83p>
* Chapter 2: <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01kjgp3#p00vw870>
* Chapter 3: <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01kjgp3#p00vw8bd>
* Chapter 4: <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01kjgp3#p00vw8j9>
* Chapter 5: <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01kjgp3#p00vw8rw>
* Chapter 6: <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01kjgp3#p00vw90k>

Does **p00vw83p** mean Chapter 1 to you? No, it's senseless.

A *good* URL would be something like:

http://bbc.co.uk/fooc/2012-07-07#1

* bbc.co.uk - [no www](http://no-www.org/)
* <abbr title="From Our Own Correspondent">fooc</abbr> is the abbreviation for BBC From Our Own Correspondent
* 2012-07-07 - simple [standardised date](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) representation
* `#1` - for Chapter 1

# No subtitles

I can't find subtitles or transcripts for any episodes of the BBC From Our Own Correspondent programme. :(

Confusingly <http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/>
links to stories in the BBC magazine like
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18828612> which are often enough article
versions of the FOOC dispatch.

# Discovery is inconsistent

* <http://www.bbc.co.uk/search/?q=FOOC> has poor results
* <http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/search?q=FOOC> does no work at all

<http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/search?q=From%20Our%20Own%20Correspondent> does work, but for example the closest match I could find to the above on [BBC Iplayer](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer) which is a different service to the [BBC podcasts](http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts) is:

<http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p00tzml5/From_Our_Own_Correspondent_Latvia_and_Bush_House_London/>

I did eventually find a [paginated
list](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qjlq/episodes/player) where some
programmes have chapters and others don't. **WHY**? And why isn't this list on [Iplayer](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/search?q=From%20Our%20Own%20Correspondent)?

Internet listeners have to think, do I listen to BBC FOOC on the Web, or Podcast or on
Iplayer? Don't make people think! A single reliable URL to each dispatch with
say HTML5 audio which is accessible to listen to and download is what we need!

Another inconsistent aspect to the way FOOC content is organised on the BBC is
again how [BBC News has magazine entries for example of a dispatch on the
Mussolini's bunker](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18828612) that links to
same programme of FOOC on the World Service at
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p002vsng> and
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/archive/default.stm>.
I'm aware there is a "World Service" version of FOOC for the Radio, but does it
mean it has to make the Website confusing to navigate? There is no clear
consistent canonical link to the Mussolini's bunker dispatch for example. 

My favourite programme on the BBC is a mess on the Web and a great example of poor [URL design](http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html).
