# st

Great [simple terminal](http://st.suckless.org/), but it does not have scroll back support, aka "scrollbackabilty". :)

For remedy this use [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/).

# tmux setup in <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a>'s config.h

	static const char *termcmd[]  = { "st", "-e", "tmux", NULL };

`tmux` has some added bonuses, like keeping the width so for example `tail -f
/var/log/everything.log` doesn't get truncated when you want to do a copy&paste
to a new window.

# tmux local and remotely?

If you run a default tmux and you log into a remote machine, you need to prefix
your commands twice to for example open a new shell on the remote machine, e.g. `C-b C-b c`

You can work around this like I do by [setting up your local
tmux](https://github.com/kaihendry/Kai-s--HOME/blob/master/.tmux.conf) to use a
different prefix, in my case the bloated `GNU screen` prefix, `C-a`.
