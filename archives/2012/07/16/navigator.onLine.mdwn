After several abortive attempts of trying to use [HTML5 Application
cache](http://developers.whatwg.org/offline.html), I decided to turn
[Greptweet](http://greptweet.com/) into an offline capable Web application and
I learnt a ton on along the way.

If you have [code](https://github.com/kaihendry/Greptweet/blob/86dfd044aa458342c4d8e46b00f1e95dbcb72508/main.js#L24) in your application that looks like:

	if (navigator.onLine) {
		// Do something server side
	} else {
		// Do something locally
	}

You are probably doing it wrong. Why?

The `navigator.onLine` attribute is inherently unreliable. "A computer can be
connected to a network without having Internet access." as
<http://developers.whatwg.org/offline.html#browser-state> says and as my
[suckless](http://suckless.org) compatriots point out: Aside from **physical
link state**, there is no way to tell the difference between an 'offline'
network and a highly latent one. Microsoft determines it is by pinging one of
their servers(!).

It gets worse if you are a <abbr title="linux user">luser</abbr> because if you
are sane and shun bloatware like [dbus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Bus) and
the bonkers [Network Manager](http://projects.gnome.org/NetworkManager/) then
`navigator.onLine` will simply not work on a typical Linux distribution like
[Debian](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=681782) or
[Archlinux](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/30704). [Linux
Chrome](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=137501) for example
[depends on
org.freedesktop.NetworkManager](http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/src/net/base/network_change_notifier_linux.cc) to work.


So what's the solution? I think individual Web apps need to determine
`navigator.onLine` themselves by doing a http request and if you don't get a
200 in x seconds you set your own `navigator.onLine` variable to false. I know
at least one [Web signage](http://neon.webconverger.com/) application that does
this already. It's obviously important for a public sign to stay robust and
work offline in the case of spotty internet connectivity.

After writing [Greptweet](http://greptweet.com/) with [Offline HTML
Appcache](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/offline.html#offline)
features, I don't think I need `grep.php` anymore. So another approach is to
rely on sync using the cache manifest and localStorage, and design your Web
application not to act on application data remotely.
