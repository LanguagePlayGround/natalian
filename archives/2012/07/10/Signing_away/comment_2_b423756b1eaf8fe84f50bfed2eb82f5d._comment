Just use GNUPG to create a signature of the document and send it back.

It is far harder to fake, and more reliable. Your email program may offer a feature for doing this - hopefully transparently - but do make sure it signs the attachment.

Adobe PDF tools offer a digital signature option, but why bother when it is easier to click \"reply\" and type \"I agree to the contract\".
