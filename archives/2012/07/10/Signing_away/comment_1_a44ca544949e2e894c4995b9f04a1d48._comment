I have also added a photograph of my signature to a document and emailed it straight back, it was accepted without question, even though it was obviously a photograph. I realised afterwards that if you threshold the image, to make it black and white, or even make the image a low bit depth, it would look a lot like you had re-scanned it.

I doubt there's anyone who could ever reliably detect a decent forged signature. I think it's more in the theory than in the practicality, it's probably very illegal to forge someone's signature, and you're quite likely to get found out eventually. It would be interesting to know the legalities behind it.
