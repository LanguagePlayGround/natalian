I remember scribbling my hand signature again and again in my notebook on a
boring day at school in Marist Brothers, St Henrys. Then and there I knew it
would be important way of verifying that it was me. So it was important for my
signature to be distinctive and consistent.

In Finland I thought I would do an experiment, more so to see if shop cashiers
would have the guts to question a foreigner (me). I signed my name with a X
when paying for groceries. This was at a time before
[Chip&PIN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip_and_PIN). Never once was I 
questioned. This probably says more about the trusting Finnish culture than
anything else. I did it so often, I accidentally would put a X when I really did mean
to sign!

Already 10 years my signature became a very weak way of identifying myself.

Fast forward to 2012 and for a lot of business agreements, I would typically get sent a PDF like the one below:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/7542966904/" title="please-sign by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8144/7542966904_2fc689c7e1.jpg" width="500" height="283" alt="please-sign"></a>

This one is a badly photocopied one, which I'm supposed to sign. This process is a huge PITA. It normally involves:

1) Printing the PDF - hard if you don't have a printer
2) Signing it
3) Scanning it - tricky if you don't have a scanner (camera would probably suffice)
4) Sending the scan back

Apparently there is a solution by way of a feature in [Preview.App in
MacOSX](http://twitter.com/wolframkriesing/status/222678037630693376) or one
could just [edit the PDF in GIMP and paste in one's signate
copy](http://twitter.com/edent/status/222678592092508160).

Of course a PNG of your signature sounds a bit dangerous. But in practice, this is what people do!

It gets even more WEIRD when one can sign using [Echo Sign](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EchoSign) by just typing your full name in a field. Er... this isn't secure now is it?

So we've gone from hand written signatures, where I guess a hand writing
specialist could detect a fraud. To 2012 when if you can type my full name you
could probably enter me in an agreement.

I can't help but think than legal hawks should think about developing better
technology for identifying parties in agreements. Then again when we have click
throughs on 100 page like T&Cs, one has to wonder... how the fuck did we get
here?
