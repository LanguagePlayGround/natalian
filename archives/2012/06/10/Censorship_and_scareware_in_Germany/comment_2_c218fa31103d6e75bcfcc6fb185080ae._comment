I'm not saying that simply visiting the site is illegal, so I'm not \"confused\" (ad hominem). Your point is minutiae in any case.


I severely doubt these unscrupulous lawyers got a court order for **every IP** they caught in their suspected honey trap. That would be a gross invasion of privacy surely?

I compare this to having perhaps parked your car on private property. The private landlord knowing your driver's plate, can now knock on your door threatening you for payment. That would be a crazy state of affairs, wouldn't it?
