It's funny that you chose that example because that is exactly what happens, the DVLA will sell your details, given your licence plate number, to virtually anyone who asks for it, allowing that person to levy fines.

If you are not confused then I think you need to rewrite your post to remove references to a) Germany and b) the Pirate Bay, since neither is relevant to your argument and just confuses the matter.

Like it or not sharing copyrighted material is illegal, what you are complaining about is how the law is implemented, what you should be complaining about is the fact that it's illegal at all.
