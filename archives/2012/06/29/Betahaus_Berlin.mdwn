# No free coffee

Postage system is useful, but I wanted just ONE thing sent to me, a SIM card.
And I didn't want to pay 25EUR for one month for the facility, just to put my name down
to receive one thing.

If you buy coffee, you need to take it up 3 flights of stairs. No delivery. This totally sucks.

There is a 2EUR morning coffee service, but sheesh!

# No drinking water

Every office space needs an easy way to get cold drinking water imo.

# Internet problems

The internet often doesn't work in the cafe and it's not good enough on the 3rd floor.

# PITA to climb the steps everyday

This goes for [co-up](http://co-up.de/) too. Anyway, it's a PITA.

# Silent room has terrible accoustics

Move a chair or table and it reverbs across the room

# No wired access

I need wired access ideally for Internet, since I'm on ssh all day. Wireless latency bites.

# Bad balance

In one room there were visual / marketing types. At least that's the way I've
categorized them in my brain. I can't afford to overhear conversations on such
topics I do not care remotely about. So I did prefer the "peace & quiet" of the
silent room. But then that fealt anti-social since I couldn't meet or talk with
any other fellow developers

I much prefer [co-up](http://co-up.de/) as a co-working space in Berlin as it's rammed with software **developers**.
