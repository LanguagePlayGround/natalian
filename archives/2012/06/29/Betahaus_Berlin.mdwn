Stuff I didn't like about Betahaus


* No free coffee

Postage system is useful, but I wanted just ONE thing sent to me, a SIM card.
And I didn't want to pay 25EUR for one month the facility, to put my name down
to receive one thing.

If you buy coffee, you need to take it up 3 flights of stairs. No delivery. This totally sucks.

There is a 2EUR morning coffee service, but sheesh!


The internet often doesn't work in the cafe and it's not good enough on the 3rd floor.
