What I do not enjoy about my Apple iPhone is setting up 3G Internet on different carriers when I travel.

I've had the SAME problem in Singapore (Starhub), UK (3UK) & Germany (Simyo, though I think [Fyve](http://www.fyve.de/) looks much better).

It usually involves:

1) Resetting your network settings by going into Settings -> General -> Reset -> Reset Network Settings

Now you've nuked your 3G settings and all those precious Wifi passwords, hopefully your carrier is SANE enough to support DEFAULT [APN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_Point_Name) settings. (Whatever they are) Often this isn't the case. :(

2) Next you need to somehow get your new 3G carrier to send your Iphone the APN
settings in the form of a MMS message that gets installed as a "Profile". I
actually prefer Android here, because on Android it is straightforward to manually
update <abbr title="Access Point Name">APN</abbr> settings after Googling for
your new operator's APN settings.

In Germany [I asked Simyo](http://twitter.com/kaihendry/status/216188151750852609), but no response. Then I delve into the mess of their Website to eventually find two important links:

* <http://www.simyo.de/mobile-welt/mobiles-internet/handy-einstellungen.html>
* <https://eplus.smarttrust.com/portal/authsec/portal/ScaPortalsimyo/default/downloadSettingsWindow?messagekey=download_settings.settings_sent&action=2>

After authenticating again, it does send you a SMS link and MMS, accept, accept and BOOM Internet! Was that so hard?

Yes it was.
