[[!meta title="Will Aliens be able to hear us?"]]

I notice stories like this [Alien Hunters story on BBC
News](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-16273512). For example:

	I Love Lucy signals are more than 50 light years away, and our nearest stars have already received Simpsons broadcasts

I see a problem with this. The way broadcasting has gone in my mind is this:

1. 80 odd years of terrestrial analogue broadcast. Lets face it, 80 years in the age of the Universe isn't very long at all.
2. Everything going [digital](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_terrestrial_television) - making it very difficult to decode, surely?

Since with digital terrestrial television, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television">high
definition</a> is not as easy to do as with
[satellite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_television), therefore most
people switch to satellite and the popularity of digital terrestrial wanes.
With satellite, the signal is directed to Earth and I assume not much of it
reflects back.

Finally the trend prevails were most people just watch "TV" off the Internet.
Making Digital terrestrial television even more irrelevant along with Satellite
television.

So if broadcasting is replaced with the Internet how do aliens actually hear
us? WIFI signals? I severely doubt they can travel into space and make any
sense to decode.
