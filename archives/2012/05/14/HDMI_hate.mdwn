[HDMI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI) or "hit-me" as I like to call it, is
one step forward and two steps **backwards** because:

# You cannot hotplug HDMI

Initialisation of connected HDMI only happens on (cold) boot. So if you switch
or connect HDMI devices it probably won't correctly negotiate the mode.

That sucks.

UPDATE: This just might be the case for MY hardware, not [others](http://twitter.com/#!/Ngeow/status/201852431036985344) for which it might "just work"

# Displays cannot detect HDMI sources

Maybe it's our Samsung UE46C6530 TV, though if you search the interwebs many
other devices seem to suffer with this auto switching "problem".

You end up having to **manually** choose the input device. Awkward.

# Furthermore

It's a bit annoying that on my X220 Thinkpad
[DisplayPort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayPort) to HDMI, that it
doesn't supply the audio channel along with the signal. Probably should blame
Lenovo, but why doesn't work? Incompatities?

Confusingly:

	> DisplayPort 1.2 is the future interface for PC monitors, along with HDMI 1.4a for TV connectivity.
