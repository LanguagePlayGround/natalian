In a similar vein to my [[daily electricity cost|archives/2008/06/29/daily-electricity-cost]] investigations 4 years ago, I
thought I should work out the costs for <http://prazefarm.co.uk/>.

This is a big issue for our family since oil prices have rocketed left us
testing our brains trying to work out questions like:

1. Is it cheaper to do hot water with electricity?
2. Is a immersion heater the way to go or are there more efficient options?

For general heating we do recently bring out a Japanese style electric heater,
but we struggle to compare it the cost of oil based heating since it's really
quite hard to work out the efficiency and consumption of our
[Rayburn](http://www.rayburn-web.co.uk/).

Back to electricity and I'm really quite disappointed the way electricity bills
are done still. If electricity bills and reporting were done well, I can't help
but feel people will make much better decisions.

For example how many people go nuts nowadays when someone leaves a light bulb
on? Lets assume you leave 5 20W (energy saving bulbs) running 12 hours. Lets
assume you are charged 10p per kW/h.

	0.100W*12*10= 12 pence for the day

Is it really worth going nuts over 12 pence? No.

# The EDF bill

It's in PDF which sucks. There is unsurprisingly no API and the delay is very
long. For example I logged onto <http://www.edfenergy.com/> on 2012-05-27 to
find the latest bill from 2012-01-12, almost 5 months ago.

It might be more convenient to pay a regular sum for budgeting, but again this
obfuscates what you consumption actually is. I think you need at the very least
a summer versus winter perspective.

17.5 kW/h per day is the average I assume. This figure is practically useless.
If we knew day to day our kW/h consumption then we could act upon this
information.

I think in our case the cost per kW/h is 9.73p. But just by my experience
[[before|archives/2008/06/29/daily-electricity-cost]], it's probably an
incorrect assumption when you factor in the confusing "standing charge".

I don't why [EDF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDF_Energy) have rediculous
Tariff names like [Fixed S@ver
v2](http://www.ukpower.co.uk/gas_electricity_suppliers/edf-energy/fixed-sver-v2-before-august-2011)
which is very hard to find clear information about. My mother allegedly had to
"fight" to this rate. Not sure why.
