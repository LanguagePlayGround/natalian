[Airasia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirAsia) like it or not is the cheapest
way to get around South East Asia. Unfortunately AirAsia's Website **sucks**.
It's incredible to see so many [amateur
mistakes](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6640256249).

Besides their annoyingly slow & frustrating process to purchase a ticket,
[Airasia also require you to excruciatingly "check in"
online](http://checkin.airasia.com). If you don't check in online, you need to
pay 10MYR on the counter.

"Checking in" online asks you generally for the same information **again** with
some clunky forms that will [make it hard **not** to buy
insurance](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6611784865/in/set-72157628661621975/):

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6611784739/" title="A friendly Note. Now click Cancel by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7016/6611784739_131b56eb5c.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="A friendly Note. Now click Cancel"></a>

Once you have checked in online, you then need to print your board pass. Why it
can't be completely paperless is beyond me. Now you have two equally buggy
options via this horrible form:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6611785113/" title="Email or SMS by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7153/6611785113_6327884484.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="Email or SMS"></a>

Choosing **Email** will send you a PDF. [Why
PDF](http://dabase.com/blog/PDF-A_versus_HTML/) instead of HTML, is one of
life's little mysteries. The PDF must be printed before you get to the Airport,
showing this PDF from your phone will be **useless** at the baggage drop off
counter.

If you go for the SMS option, you will get a URL link like so:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6611785293/" title="SMS by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7170/6611785293_1cf067c421.jpg" width="300" height="500" alt="SMS"></a>

Confusingly I couldn't find this SMS at the airport as it uses the same from
address as my taxi provider.

Hopefully you will manage to follow the WAP (yes, seriously, in 2012)
<http://m.airasia.com> site link to a [Aztec
code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_Code), that looks like this:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6611798415/" title="Android portrait by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7159/6611798415_536f175976.jpg" width="300" height="500" alt="Android portrait"></a>

You need to scan this with one of the machines in the airport. Hopefully your
mobile renders it without being
[clipped](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6611798473/in/set-72157628661621975/).
From there you get a slip of paper allowing you to proceed to the baggage drop
off counter.

Phew. Airasia, there is a lot of a room for improvement here. Hire someone who
knows what they are doing and look at
[Fluentspace](http://www.facebook.com/fluentspace) for local talent.
