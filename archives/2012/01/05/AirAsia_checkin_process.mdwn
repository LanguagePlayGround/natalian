[Airasia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirAsia) like it or not is the cheapest
way to get around South East Asia. Unfortunately [AirAsia's Website](http://www.airasia.com) **sucks**.
It's incredible to see so many [amateur
mistakes](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6640256249).

Besides their annoyingly slow & frustrating process to purchase a ticket,
[Airasia also require you to excruciatingly "check in"
online](http://checkin.airasia.com). If you don't check in online, you need to
pay 10MYR on the counter.

"Checking in" online asks you generally for the same information **again** with
some clunky forms that try [trick you into buying their
Insurance](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6611784865/in/set-72157628661621975/).

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6611784739/" title="A friendly Note. Now click Cancel by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7016/6611784739_131b56eb5c.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="A friendly Note. Now click Cancel"></a>

Once you have checked in online, you then need to print your board pass. Why it
can't be completely paperless is beyond me. Now you have two equally buggy
options via this horrible form:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6611785113/" title="Email or SMS by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7153/6611785113_6327884484.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="Email or SMS"></a>

Choosing **Email** will send you a PDF. [Why
PDF](http://dabase.com/blog/PDF-A_versus_HTML/) instead of HTML, is one of
life's little mysteries. The PDF must be printed before you get to the Airport,
showing this PDF from your phone will be **useless** at the baggage drop off
counter. Why? The PDF doesn't contain the important [Aztec
code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_Code) (see below) and for some bizaare
reason [Airasia include **four** useless confusing barcodes in the PDF](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6640306607).

Another crazy element to the page is that the checkin [session can
expire](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6611785225/in/set-72157628661621975).
Which idiot coded that? Weep and start again.

If you go for the SMS option, you will get a URL link like so:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6611785293/" title="SMS by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7170/6611785293_1cf067c421.jpg" width="300" height="500" alt="SMS"></a>

Confusingly I couldn't find this SMS at the airport as it uses the same from
address as my taxi provider. I don't know how dumbphones are supposed to handle
the URL, I expected some sort of booking code to be delivered by SMS... sigh.

Hopefully you will manage to follow "barcode link" the WAP (yes, seriously, in
2012) <http://m.airasia.com> site link to a [Aztec
code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_Code) (not a barcode), that looks like
this:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6611798415/" title="Android portrait by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7159/6611798415_536f175976.jpg" width="300" height="500" alt="Android portrait"></a>

Hopefully your mobile renders it without being
[clipped](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6611798473/in/set-72157628661621975/)
due to large silly header "Scan 2D barcode in exchange for Boarding Pass".  Now
you need to scan this with one of the (hopefully working) printing machines in
the airport. From there you get a slip of paper allowing you to proceed to the
baggage drop off counter.

Dear Airasia, there is a lot of a room for improvement here. Don't make your
customers jump through hoops and so blazenly upsell Insurance and holidays. How
about [hosting your site in Malaysia instead of
Europe](http://toolbar.netcraft.com/site_report?url=http://www.airasia.com)!?
Hire someone who knows what they are doing, look at
[Fluentspace](http://www.facebook.com/fluentspace) for local Malaysian talent.
Also please consider deploying a public
[BTS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_tracking_system) (like <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a>), so
customers can file bugs with your process and also see some followup.
