I was to pleased to purchase a [Powershot Canon
S100](http://twitter.com/#!/kaihendry/status/147927762873749504) #308030000785
from the Canon Concept store in Kuala Lumpur's MidValley mall. It's 80GBP
cheaper than the [Amazon.co.uk
listing](http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=Canon+S100&x=0&y=0)
and I got it before its general release. I _was_ pleased.

However [2 days
later](http://twitter.com/#!/kaihendry/status/148621005953318912) during my
holiday which I bought the camera for, it stopped working. Canon S100 was
taking black photos and videos. :(

Tbh I wasn't that impressed with the GPS lock speed and the camera being faulty
made me instinctively pack it up for a refund.

However the small print of the receipt which is incidentally typed over says
Goods are not refundable & exchangable which sucks a lot. In England I'm spoilt
with consumer rights and Amazon's 14 day refund policy. Now my consumer
confidence in Malaysia is rapped.

I've since returned from my holiday yesterday, when back to the Midvalley Canon
store. I did ask for a refund and they sales assistant Liew said the best he
could do was send it in for a priority repair. Which can take 3-4 weeks.

I did also separately email <helpdesk.admin@cmm.canon.com.my> who took a few days back to me tell me I should send the device to:

	Canon Marketing Malaysia,
	Block D, Peremba Square,
	Saujana Resort, Section U2,
	40150 Shah Alam,
	Selangor Darul Ehsan,
	Malaysia.

They did not offer to collect or pay for postage and packaging.

Maybe I'm spoilt in England. But after this experience and the
[[archives/2010/10/11/Canon_IXUS_1000_HS]], I don't think I will ever buy Canon
again. Other companies like Apple can offer good world wide customer service
end consumer rights. Why can't Canon?
