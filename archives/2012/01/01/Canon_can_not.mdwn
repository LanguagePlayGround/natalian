I was to pleased to purchase a [Powershot Canon
S100](http://twitter.com/#!/kaihendry/status/147927762873749504) #308030000785
from the Canon Concept store in Kuala Lumpur's MidValley mall. It's 80GBP
cheaper than the [Amazon.co.uk
listing](http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=Canon+S100&x=0&y=0)
and I got it before its general release. I _was_ pleased.

However [2 days
later](http://twitter.com/#!/kaihendry/status/148621005953318912) during my
holiday which I bought the camera for, it stopped working. Canon S100 was
taking black photos and videos. :(

Tbh I wasn't that impressed with the GPS lock speed and the camera being faulty
made me instinctively pack it up for a refund.

However the small print of the receipt (which is incidentally typed over and
hard to read) says Goods are not refundable & exchangeable which sucks a lot.
:/ In England I'm spoilt with [consumer rights](http://whatconsumer.co.uk/what-are-my-statutory-rights/) and [Amazon's 30 day refund
policy](http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_901888_prod_ce?nodeId=901908). Now my **consumer confidence in Malaysia has been lost**.

I've since returned from my holiday yesterday and took the trouble to go back
to the Midvalley Canon store. I did ask for a refund and the sales assistant
Liew said the best he could do was send it in for a priority repair. Which can
take upto 3-4 weeks.

I did also separately email <helpdesk.admin@cmm.canon.com.my> who took a few days back to me tell me I should send the device to:

	Canon Marketing Malaysia,
	Block D, Peremba Square,
	Saujana Resort, Section U2,
	40150 Shah Alam,
	Selangor Darul Ehsan,
	Malaysia.

They did not offer to collect or pay for postage and packaging, even after asking. :/

Maybe I'm spoilt in Europe. But after this experience and the
[[archives/2010/10/11/Canon_IXUS_1000_HS]], I don't think I will ever buy Canon
products again. I'm also thinking of testing the [Malaysia small claims
court](http://legal-malaysia.blogspot.com/2008/08/small-claim-court-do-it-yourself-diy.html).

Other companies like Apple can offer good world wide customer service end
consumer rights. Why can't Canon?

Update, two weeks later, it has been repaired!

Come pick me up (PITA):
