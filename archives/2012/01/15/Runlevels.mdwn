Runlevels is one of those things that struck me when first using Linux as a bit
weird, only later to discover in life that it's one of those over engineered
elements from UNIX that one just ends up ignoring instead of doing anything
about it.

	Runlevels:
	0    Halt
	1(S)       Single-user
	2    Not used
	3    Multi-user
	4    Not used
	5    X11
	6    Reboot

In `/etc/inittab` I actually bother to use runlevel 5, like so:

	x:5:once:/bin/su - -- hendry -l -c '/usr/bin/startx </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1'

To boot into runlevel 5, you need to append '5' to your Linux boot
`/proc/cmdline`, like so in my `/boot/syslinux/syslinux.cfg`:

	# (0) Arch Linux
	LABEL arch
		MENU LABEL Arch Linux
		LINUX ../vmlinuz-linux
		APPEND root=/dev/sdb1 ro 5
		INITRD ../initramfs-linux.img

As you can see this is quite the nightmare to script if you wanted your new
machine to be automatically configured with your [config from
git](http://git.webconverger.org/?p=home.git;). So I am making a note of this,
so I have a reference when I spend the customary day setting up my Archlinux
box once purchasing a new machine.

If you run `runlevel`, you can confirm which runlevel you're in. You can run
`init 6` to reboot and `init 0` to halt. `init 1` is to boot into an odd mode
without networking IIRC, still don't actually know what it's all about.
