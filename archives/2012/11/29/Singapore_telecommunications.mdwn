If you are just getting started in Singapore, the best value prepaid seems to
be Starhub. **BEWARE**: You get charged for incoming calls in Singapore with StarHub.

Honestly Starhub's 3G doesn't work at times. Worse than Berlin. I've used their
service on and off for year, with different devices. Problems don't get fixed.
It's absolutely crazy.

So I've been investigating (their Websites are shit, so I've actually queued up
at their shops in Bugis) the options and they are not good:

* Singtel (Flexi Lite)
* M1 who buys capacity from Singtel (iPhone Value+)

Both their entry level contract plans are ... 39SGD pcm. 2GB is included, 4G is
included if your phone is capable and ~5SGD for extra gig in excess.

M1 is seemingly better because if you take two lines out with them, you can get
free calls between the two. Also minimum contract with M1 is 3 months, instead
of 24 months with Singtel.

You can only open a contract if you physically have the full employment pass,
not a preliminary one.

# Fixed line

You can check if you can Fibre optic here: <http://www.opennet.com.sg/>

If you can't get Fibre Optic, you are usually stuck with 10Mbps ADSL for
49.90SGD a month.

It's worth noting that even the allegedly [fastest Fibre in
Singapore](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/tags/viewqwest/) is probably not
going to get much better than [100 KB/s to Europe](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/8270641909/).

# Some gotchas with M1 contract plans

There is no online billing until you get your first paper bill and then you
need to manually switch over.

They won't warn you if you go over the 2GB quota. In order to avoid getting
charged for going over quote you must go to Settings > General > Usage >
Cellular usage and remember to reset statistics monthly.

There is a 26.70SGD charge for the SIM itself. Plus a 10.70SGD registration
charge. They don't tell you this until you sign up. haha ha...

They cannot port a prepaid number.

Do NOT roam on this, is the advice of sales representative in Bugis. Even in
Malaysia, it's too expensive.

Unlike [[Malaysia|archives/2012/01/01/Canon_can_not]], you do have <a

protecting your consumer rights for products, but not services. You can
complain to [CASE](http://www.case.org.sg/) though. There is no cooling off
period to evaluate if the network works for you.

The good news is M1's 4G is quite nice when it works. There are some issues.
Like you can't upload on the IOS6 YouTube in HD which sucks.

Online customer service is non-existent.
