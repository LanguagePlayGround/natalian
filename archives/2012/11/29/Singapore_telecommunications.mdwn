If you are just getting started in Singapore, the best value prepaid seems to
be Starhub. **BEWARE**: You get charged for incoming calls in Singapore.

Honestly Starhub's 3G doesn't work at times. Worse than Berlin. I've used their
service on and off for year, with different devices. Problems don't get fixed.
It's absolutely crazy.

So I've been investigating (their Websites are shit, so I've actually queued up
at their shops in Bugis) the options and they are not good:

* Singtel (Flexi Lite)
* M1 who buys capacity from Singtel (iPhone Value+)

Both their entry level contract plans are ... 39SGD pcm. 2GB is included, 4G is
included if your phone is capable and ~5SGD for extra gig in excess.

M1 is seemingly better because if you take two lines out with them, you can get
free calls between the two. Also minimum contract with M1 is 3 months, instead
of 24 months with Singtel.

You can only open a contract if you physically have the full employment pass,
not a preliminary one.

You can check if you can Fibre optic here: <http://www.opennet.com.sg/>

If you can't get Fibre Optic, you are usually stuck with 10Mbps ADSL for
49.90SGD a month.
