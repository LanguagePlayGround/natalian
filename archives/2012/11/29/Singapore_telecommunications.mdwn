If you are just getting started in Singapore, the best value prepaid seems to
be Starhub. **BEWARE**: You get charged for incoming calls in Singapore with StarHub.

Honestly Starhub's 3G doesn't work at times. Worse than Berlin. I've used their
service on and off for year, with different devices. Problems don't get fixed.
It's absolutely crazy.

So I've been investigating (their Websites are shit, so I've actually queued up
at their shops in Bugis) the options and they are not good:

* Singtel (Flexi Lite)
* M1 who buys capacity from Singtel (iPhone Value+)

Both their entry level contract plans are ... 39SGD pcm. 2GB is included, 4G is
included if your phone is capable and ~5SGD for extra gig in excess.

M1 is seemingly better because if you take two lines out with them, you can get
free calls between the two. Also minimum contract with M1 is 3 months, instead
of 24 months with Singtel.

You can only open a contract if you physically have the full employment pass,
not a preliminary one.

# Fixed line

You can check if you can Fibre optic here: <http://www.opennet.com.sg/>

If you can't get Fibre Optic, you are usually stuck with 10Mbps ADSL for
49.90SGD a month.

It's worth noting that even the alledgely [fastest Fibre in
Singapore](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/tags/viewqwest/) is probably not
going to get much better than [100 KB/s to Europe](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/8270641909/).

# Some gotchas with M1 plans

They won't warn you if you go over the 2GB quota. In order to avoid getting
charged for going over quote you must go to Settings > General > Usage >
Cellular usage and remember to reset statistics monthly.

Like [Malaysia](http://natalian.org/archives/2012/01/01/Canon_can_not/), you
don't have any consumer rights. You can complain to
[CASE](http://www.case.org.sg/) though. There is no cooling off period to
evaluate if the network works for you.

The good news is M1's 4G works quite well.
