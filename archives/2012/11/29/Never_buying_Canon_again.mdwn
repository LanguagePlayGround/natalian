Since getting my [Canon S100
repaired](http://natalian.org/archives/2012/01/01/Canon_can_not/) late in 2011
in Malaysia, it **failed again** on another holiday earlier in 2012.

The distress and annoyance of this Canon digital camera purchase is beyond
words. The lens could not be retracted, so it could not fit in it's nice case.
I travel a lot. I chose to try forget I wasted 300GBP on it.

**7 months later**, Canon acknowledge the endemic [Powershot S100 lens
error](http://www.canon-europe.com/Support/Consumer_Products/products/cameras/Digital_Compact/Powershot_S_series/PowerShot_S100.aspx?faqtcmuri=tcm:13-942824&page=1&type=important)
issue and offer free repairs.

Yesterday I put the camera for repair **again** in Singapore and they admitted
under conditions that the body was scratched. Adds insult to injury. The camera
could not be put in it's case because the lens could not retract!

Once getting this back, I want to sell it immediately. What a disaster. Anyway
I find the Iphone5 camera is fine for my needs.

Due to Canon's incredibly poor customer service, I urge you to never buy Canon
products.
