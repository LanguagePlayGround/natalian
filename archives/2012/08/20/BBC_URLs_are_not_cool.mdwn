Carrying from my earlier moan about the
[FOOC_URLs](/archives/2012/07/15/BBC_FOOC_URLs_make_no_sense), here are more
example of crazy URLs produced by the BBC:

* Old URL: <http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/more_or_less/>
* New URL: <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qshd>

Firstly does "b006qshd" make any sense to you? No? Well it should! BBC
engineers, did you not consider something sensible like
<http://bbc.co.uk/programmes/more_or_less>?

Secondly if the URL does change, it should seamlessly redirect. Currently you
need to click the new obfuscated URL to get the latest content for this
particular programme.

Another example, "Money Box"'s old URL is <http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/moneybox/default.stm> and the new URL is <http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qjnv>.

If you are wondering what the **2** means in the old URL, AFAICT it means
outside the UK. In the UK you will have a **1** instead of the **2**. Sad to
see the old URLs built that "Geo" conciousness in their site, so there old URLs
aren't great either.

Another thing the BBC Web production do badly is dates. This is especially
annoying when old stories bubble up on **Most Popular** Video/Audio panel on
the [BBC News](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/) site.
