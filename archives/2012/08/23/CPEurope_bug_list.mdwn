* Hard to find people

Label the tables, so I can say, meet me at B6!

* Expensive food and drink

5EUR for a cheeseburger
3EUR for a Club Mate with a 50c deposit
2.50EUR for bottled water

Crazy token system.

* No drinking water

Now you need to buy it at 2.50EUR a pop

* No wireless Internet

Registration clerk said the venue is too big for wireless. Er really?

Next guy at the computer registration desk said there is two ESSID points but
only with 1000IPs. 1000 IPs on a ipv6 network .... right...

Wireless basically did not work from my iPhone.

* Sound acoustics were awful

Sound quality is awful and nauseating inside

* No alcohol

I can understand this... but it does suck.

* Pity they don't use the outdoor space, like encouraging activities like roller skating.
