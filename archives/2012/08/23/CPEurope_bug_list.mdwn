## Hard to find people

Label the tables, so I can say, meet me at B6!

## Expensive food and drink

* 5EUR for a cheeseburger
* 2.5EUR for a Club Mate with a 1EUR deposit
* 2.50EUR for bottled water

Crazy token system to make it worse. And the food was generally pretty poor
quality, with a friend getting sick on the doner. :(

## No drinking water

Now you need to buy it at 2.50EUR a pop.

Or you can go to the toilets in the front of the building, a good 10 minutes round trip.

## No wireless Internet

Registration clerk said the venue is too big for wireless. Er really?

Next guy at the computer registration desk said there is two ESSID points but
only with 1000IPs. 1000 IPs on a ipv6 network .... right...

Wireless basically did not work from my iPhone. :/

## Sound acoustics were terrible

Sound quality is awful and nauseating inside. Very tiring.

## No alcohol

I can understand this... but it does suck especially in the free city of Berlin.

## Outside space closed off

Pity they don't use the outdoor space, like encouraging activities like roller skating.

## Videos are not that easy to access

You need to login to use them which made them difficult to share. Most videos seemed well recorded except:

A lot of the videos seem poorly labelled.

I don't understand why on the Campus Party player videos from the Campus Party in **EUROPE** are labelled with American flags.
