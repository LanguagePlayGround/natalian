I use a program called [sloccount](http://www.dwheeler.com/sloccount/) which isn't great tbh. Like IIRC it doesn't properly count Ruby code.

So yes sometimes I do use `wc -l`, and \"no\" I don't think it's worse than useless. I am aware of the sweeping generalisations I make! ;)

There was an interesting new proposal to count C by semi-colons and I guess Javascript can be applied the same way;
