Hi! I just wanted to say thanks for documenting your install and problems/solutions with Arch on an X220. When I was looking at laptops to replace my X100e (I found that it wasn't powerful enough to be my primary computer in college, and also it's having hard drive errors), being able to find you and http://blog.jamiek.it/2011/10/arch-linux-on-thinkpad-x220.html was really helpful in making me feel less alone and like Arch would actually work. I haven't ordered mine yet, because of Lenovo's website, but I'm really looking forward to installing Arch on my X220 at some point in the near future, since I love using Arch on my T42...
