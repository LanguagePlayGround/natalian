Is there some reason you don't want to use UEFI? I'm using a SATA SSD (Intel X-25) GPT with UEFI and it works great on Arch. I have had 2 booting issues, however. First is that it pauses for a few seconds then gives me a \"comreset error, errno=16\", and the second is that sometimes it hangs on udev for a while then udev fails and boot continues normally. Neither prevent it from booting but definitely slow down the boot times.
