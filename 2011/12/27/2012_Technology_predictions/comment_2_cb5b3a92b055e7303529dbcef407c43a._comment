Thanks for the comment [Daniel](http://twitter.com/#!/riveong)! From what you said Enterprise social networking tool = Wiki. Great, I understand that & totally agree.

I also understand most corporates roll out \"Enterprise\" wiki which suck in one godawful way or another. E.g. Liferay or even Redmine's wiki. Truly terrible. <http://ikiwiki.info/> is a good wiki on the other hand.

As for asking questions. This is not great in Facebook as [Benjamin](http://daydeed.com/) will tell you. ;) What about good old fashioned mailing lists? I guess corporate culture of no enforced email etiquette... i.e. HTML email and top posting has killed that medium.

The Iraq war wiki example is a little funny considering that intelligence gathering for that was widely seen as a complete disaster! ;)
