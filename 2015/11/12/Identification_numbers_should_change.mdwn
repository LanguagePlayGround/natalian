Seven odd years ago I lamented the [UK identity system after becoming a victim
of fraud](/2007/11/06/security-through-obscurity/).

After some experience with other identity schemes, I've actually started to
think the UK system is the best.

Why? Because your identity number **CHANGES** when your passport is renewed.

"Key rotation" is a good thing. It allows you to start fresh and actually shrug
off any compromise.

Compare that with almost every other identity scheme in the world where you are
stuck with a number you cannot change. A static identity hanging around your
neck like a noose.

However there is a con of an identity number changing in some countries. For
example in Malaysia **EVERYTHING** hinges on an **IC number**. For foreigners
in Malaysia this is your passport number. If your passport number changes, the
whole system comes crumbling down. Your credit score is reset. You almost
should apply for a new contract for just about everything.

And despite this, it's still worth it. Well done Britain.
