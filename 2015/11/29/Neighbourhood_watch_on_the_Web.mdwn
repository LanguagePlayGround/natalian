[[!meta description="A simple way to notify guards by SMS is devised and implemented"]]

UPDATE: Implementation: <https://github.com/kaihendry/myresponder>

Since my mother-in-law was robbed a few months back and since I've observed
security in our neighbourhood to be lacklustre, I have been thinking of a
simple alarm system.

In my mind this incident could have been mitigated if there was a **quick** and
easy way to notify the local guard house. Currently finding the number, calling
it and telling who you are is far too time consuming and difficult. My goal is
to have a system as **simple** as a button press to call a guard to your house
within **2 minutes**.

First I took [pen to paper to flesh out the problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdw0xnZYQdI).

Then I created a "mock up" of how I imagine the "management page" to look like:

# Implementation challenges

## Sessions

The hardest problem in my mind is determining **who is on duty** to send the
notification too.  Since that pretty much requires some sort of [time and
attendance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_and_attendance) system. I'm
going to assume that security personal aka "responders" have access to a mobile
browser. So the problem boils down to **session management** on the back end.
Tbh I've _never_ found this trivial. Options included:

* golang [gorilla sessions](http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/sessions) looks a bit too weak but hopefully workable
* [php sessions](http://php.net/manual/en/function.session-set-save-handler.php) - probably the most mature
* nodejs & .. express? the Redis examples make me want to throw up
* django ... just too heavyweight and Python!
* rails ... urgh ... again just way too heavyweight

## Notifications themselves

I am assuming there is a reliable, **fast** and inexpensive SMS gateway in
Malaysia. Need to evaluate [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/),
[Clickatell](https://www.clickatell.com/) & [Nexmo](https://www.nexmo.com/).
Tbh I have doubts! So complementary ways need to be implemented.

* Eventsource on the Web page to update with events or [browser notifications](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/03/push-notifications-on-the-open-web?hl=en)
* Raspberry PI in the guard house to trigger an audible alarm?
* <https://pushover.net/>

## Text log

I think it's important to have a "chat like" log of every incident. And that
sort of requires an interactive 2 way chat system between the home owner & the
responders. Web sockets? Urgh! Complexity. Non-trivial. I heard a lot of
communities have an **"SOS WhatsApp"** group for this very use case.

## Human factors

Registering and signing up every house to the system will be a great challenge.
I personally would like to avoid passwords. So each home owner would need to go
through a procedure like:

1. Home owner registers upon http://uptown.watch.my/ filling in **name, address, telephone number**, submit form to be redirected to a special page
2. (optional?) Management calls number to confirm registration
3. Home owner saves special page to homescreen (simplest way on IOS/Android)

So the alarm is **raised with a GET request** (can't POST from homescreen can
you?). People could accidentally click the home screen icon and trigger an
incident. On the page that is loaded, there will be a textarea and button to
indicate an incident has been resolved.

In future I would like to see management sell wireless connected buttons
capable of performing a GET request with the correct parameters. Unlocking a
phone to click a home screen icon will be too hard for the old & very young.

There needs to buy in. Management needs to drive this initiative. Train the
security staff. **Run drills**!! And most importantly in my mind... ensure the
**response times are consistently low**.

I'm confident I can write a working prototype, in which I will be always
ensuring the system as **simple as possible**. Please let me know about
existing solutions out there and if there was anything I overlooked.
