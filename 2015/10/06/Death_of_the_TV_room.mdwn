# Can't simply power on your TV room

Look how much effort it [requires just to make everything turn on one fell swoop!!](https://samgentle.com/posts/2015-10-02-mixing-signals)

# Can't auto select input

Plug in your console and turn it on. Now spend the next 5 minutes hunting for
the right source. That's if HDMI negotiation worked, which it probably didn't.

HDMI is a broken consumer technology. Their designers seem to divide their time
making it non-hot pluggable and adding anti features like content protection.

# Too much waiting

Even if you manage to turn it on, waiting for a "SMART" TV to boot can take minutes!!

# Way way too complicated interaction

The Android TV has a crazy menu. I have not figured out how to Chrome cast to
it.

Never mind the startup wizard asking you to agree to pages and pages of T&Cs and
asking sign in to Google.

# Shout at your TV

Both Google & Apple seem to now want you to talk to your TV. Putting the
**serious privacy implications** aside ... it is an absolutely ridiculous UX
trying to do a Youtube search by voice. Whoever came up with this probably need
some time getting the shit kicked out of them.

# Can't do simple things

Use case: Playback an MP4 from a Web URL.

Apple TV has no way to do this.

On an Android TV, bizarrely I have to use the Opera browser to load a URL and
then be default enjoy a small window playback.

There is a tiny little mouse driven UI to make it full screen that escaped me
initially.  Good luck seeking around or coming back to a part where you left
of.

# Don't buy a SMART TV!

Looking around my local electronics store, there is no large "DUMB" TV screens
on offer! I can only assume all the big manufacturers are positioning
themselves to control the platform. What a disaster zone.

Goodbye TV room. I'm thinking [big monitor](http://blog.codinghorror.com/our-brave-new-world-of-4k-displays/) or [syncing small screens](https://twitter.com/kaihendry/status/648863577688772611).
