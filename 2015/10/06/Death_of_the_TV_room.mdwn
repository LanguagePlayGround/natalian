# Can't simply power on your TV room

Look how much effort it [requires just to make everything turn on one fell swoop!!](https://samgentle.com/posts/2015-10-02-mixing-signals)

# Can't auto select input

Plug in your console and turn it on. Now spend the next 5 minutes hunting for
the right source. That's if HDMI negotiation worked, which it probably didn't.

HDMI is a broken consumer technology. Their designers seem to divide their time
making it non-hot pluggable and adding anti features like content protection.

# Too much waiting

Even if you manage to turn it on, waiting for a "SMART" TV to boot can take minutes!!

# Way way too complicated interaction

The Android TV has a crazy menu. <s>I have not figured out how to Chrome cast to
it.</s> Update: Use the Youtube app from an iPhone to cast to it, but it's slow. :/

Never mind the startup wizard asking you to agree to pages and pages of T&Cs
and asking sign in to Google.

# Profiling

So if you do not sign in, Youtube seems unable to remember last searches or
display a history of last played videos.

This obviously harms to usability of the SMART TV until you sign in. I really
don't understand how this is supposed to work in a family setting with anyone's
Youtube account signed in.

# Shout at your TV

Both Google & Apple seem to now want you to talk to your TV. Putting the
**serious privacy implications** aside ... it is an absolutely ridiculous UX
trying to do a Youtube search by voice. Whoever came up with this probably need
some time getting the shit kicked out of them.

# Can't do simple things

Use case: Playback an MP4 from a Web URL.

Apple TV has no way to do this.

On an Android TV, bizarrely I have to use the Opera browser to load a URL and
then be default enjoy a small window playback.

There is a tiny little mouse driven UI to make it full screen that escaped me
initially.  Good luck seeking around or coming back to a part where you left
of.

# Google casting

Upon the Sony KDL-55W800C (Software version: PKG2.601.0052PAA) it seems to drop frames like crazy casting from a
mobile or laptop device. Resulting in near unwatchable sluggish slow playback
especially from Youtube. The ugly workaround is to painstakingly use the
awkward to input Youtube app which plays back videos smoothly.

I do not understand how Google cast is failing since IIUC it just provides a
Chrome browser a URL to start rendering.

# Don't buy a SMART TV!

Looking around my local electronics store, there is no large "DUMB" TV screens
on offer! I can only assume all the big manufacturers are positioning
themselves to control the platform. What a disaster zone.

Goodbye TV room. I'm thinking [big monitor](http://blog.codinghorror.com/our-brave-new-world-of-4k-displays/) or [syncing small screens](https://twitter.com/kaihendry/status/648863577688772611) instead.
