# Can't simply power on your TV room

Look how much effort it [requires just to make everything turn on one fell swoop!!](https://samgentle.com/posts/2015-10-02-mixing-signals)

# Can't auto select input

Plug in your console and turn it on. Now spend the next 5 minutes hunting for
the right source. That's if HDMI negotiation worked, which it probably didn't.

HDMI is a broken consumer technology. Their designers seem to divide their time
making it non-hot pluggable and adding anti features like content protection.

# Too much waiting

Even if you manage to turn it on, waiting for a "SMART" TV to boot can take minutes!!

# Way way too complicated interaction

The Android TV has a crazy menu. <s>I have not figured out how to Chrome cast to
it.</s> Update: Use the Youtube app from an iPhone to cast to it, but it's slow. :/

Never mind the startup wizard asking you to agree to pages and pages of T&Cs
and asking sign in to Google.

# Profiling

So if you do not sign in, Youtube seems unable to remember last searches or
display a history of last played videos.

This obviously harms to usability of the SMART TV until you sign in. I really
don't understand how this is supposed to work in a family setting with anyone's
Youtube account signed in.

# Shout at your TV

Both Google & Apple seem to now want you to talk to your TV. Putting the
**serious privacy implications** aside ... it is an absolutely ridiculous UX
trying to do a Youtube search by voice. Whoever came up with this probably need
some time getting the shit kicked out of them.

To make the whole experience even more terrible, the Sony Bravia doesn't seem
to actually come with a microphone. No amount of shouting will prompt a voice
interaction.

# Can't do simple things

Use case: Playback an MP4 from a Web URL.

Apple TV has no way to do this.

On an Android TV, bizarrely I have to use the Opera browser to load a URL and
then be default enjoy a small window playback (until manually resized).

There is a tiny little mouse driven UI to make it full screen that escaped me
initially.  Good luck seeking around or coming back to a part where you left
of.

# Google casting

Update: "No Cast devices found" Chromecast has completely disappeared. SOLUTION: [USE NETWORK TIME](https://sony-paa-pa-en-web--paa.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/113870/session/L3RpbWUvMTQ0NjA5ODAzNS9zaWQvbVhRdFI3QW0%3D)

Sometimes on the Sony KDL-55W800C (Software version: PKG2.601.0052PAA) it
seems to drop frames like crazy casting from a mobile or laptop device.
Resulting in near unwatchable sluggish slow playback especially from Youtube.
The ugly workaround is to painstakingly use the awkward native Youtube app to
play back videos smoothly.

# Region locked and Play store catalogue curated

I've discovered that our particular Sony KDL-55W800C is for the Asia Pacific
market. As a result, Apps like Netflix cannot be downloaded or installed. In
fact a lot of Apps like VPN Apps are just simply not available.

I tried to download the North America image with the intention to reflash the
device via USB. Unfortunately it disallows me to do this with a ["System
software cannot be updated using the USB
device."](http://s.natalian.org/2015-10-27/system-software-update.webp) message.
Sickening.

Oddly Chromecasting Netflix from a device I've VPNed to the US, results in a
[Please update the Netflix application on your mobile
device](http://s.natalian.org/2015-11-02/netflix.webp) message. Sony obviously
have made it as difficult as possible to playback "region locked" content.

# Don't buy a SMART TV!

Looking around my local electronics store, there is no large "DUMB" TV screens
on offer! I can only assume all the big manufacturers are positioning
themselves to control the platform. What a disaster zone.

Goodbye TV room. I'm thinking [big monitor](http://blog.codinghorror.com/our-brave-new-world-of-4k-displays/) or [syncing small screens](https://twitter.com/kaihendry/status/648863577688772611) instead.
