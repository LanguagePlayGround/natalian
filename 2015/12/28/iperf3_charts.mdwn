[[!meta description="Whilst internal network speeds in Singapore are great, outside to Europe are a fraction of the speed"]]

In order to better grasp Internet speed issues, I've penned [iperf3charts](https://github.com/kaihendry/iperf3chart).

Lets run through some real examples. The target `sg.dabase.com` (temporarily
running `iperf3 -s` for me, not you) is running on [Digital Ocean
Singapore](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=37b3b1850b32) and this shows
you I am maxing out my 2Gbps Gigabit [ViewQwest](http://www.viewqwest.com/)
connection. Max since I can only do 1Gbps (~100 MB/sec) at one time from my
wired laptop network port!

Now on [AC wireless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11ac) between my
X1C3 & my TPLINK Archer C7 v2, the best throughput I can get when I am very
close to the AP is ~26MB/sec. So a quarter of my 1Gbps port when wireless. Here
I am testing in my LAN:

Here is the same wireless test targeting my local Digital Ocean droplet:

Roughly the same, so we can conclude connecting to a Singapore droplet is as
fast my Singapore LAN! That's rather good!

# Going abroad

But what about **outside Singapore**??

So my 2Gbps connection to say the Netherlands in an ideal world would be
100MB/sec (1Gbps). But it's travelling up through Asia, across the US and one
can expect to be curtailed here and there. It's a testament to your ISP if your
outbound connections are high quality as this is what usually costs a lot of
money, time & effort to arrange. Sadly, the max I seem to eek from ViewQwest in
Singapore out of my Dutch droplet is ~2MB/sec. 1% of my advertised 2Gbps
connection speed.

Incidentally from my Singapore droplet, I tested the speed to my Dutch droplet:

<img src=http://s.natalian.org/2015-12-28/nl.webconverger.com_2015-12-28_eth0.svg alt="Singapore to Netherlands droplet">

Roughly 8MB/sec connection. Not great, but 4x better than my consumer connection.

If you are curious to know what kind of Internet connection speed Digital Ocean
has in Singapore, you can actually find out by looking at the size of their
ports at your local exchange. For example, at the Singapore Internet Exchange,
Digital Ocean has a 10G (1000MB/sec) port:

According to <https://beta.peeringdb.com/net/6494> they have 10G ports in
Amsterdam, but they note they operate independent networks, so there is no
telling what their guarantees there make between their deployments. In my
experience AWS have pretty solid connectivity between their "availability
zones", but again they make no guarantees.

# Evaluating your ISP

Again using [PeeringDB](https://www.peeringdb.com/) you can get a better
picture of your ISPs "peering" or connections at different exchanges in the
world.

Singtel or StarHub might have better or the same ports. But their traffic
levels are much higher so your service will probably be worse than
[ViewQwest](http://www.viewqwest.com/) who I still recommend despite these
depressing statistics.

I encourage you to run your own tests using [iperf3charts](https://github.com/kaihendry/iperf3chart)! If you need an iperf server to target,
contact me. Else just [spawn a
droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=37b3b1850b32) or an AWS EC2
instance and get `iperf3 -s` running on it.

UPDATE: ViewQwest are **responsive** which already beats all other Singaporean
ISPs and they told me: "For NL, redo your tests in February. We have a 10G link
SG-Amsterdam direct coming up which is taking almost 3 months to be ready."
