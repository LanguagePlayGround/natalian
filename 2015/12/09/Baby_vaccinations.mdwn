So since I have a baby boy, I've taken the responsibility for making sure he's
immunised.

For the last "hexaxim branded" vaccine [Columbia Asia
PJ](/2015/10/20/Delivering_a_baby_in_Malaysia/) (a private hospital) charges
149.62MYR for the vaccine & 72MYR consultation fees. That's **221MYR** or
**73.15SGD** at today's currency exchange rates.

Sidenote: I'm told that these vaccinations are free of cost in Malaysian
government clinics.

So since the next vaccination is due at the end of December where we will be
returning to Singapore, I've asked the "government hospital" in Singapore [KK
Women's and Children's Hospital](http://www.kkh.com.sg/) for their service.
They **charge 221SGD** which include $141.24 (Consultation Fees)+Vaccine
injection $49.31 (include GST)+$30 (procedure).

Can cheaper be found in Singapore or is this the stark reality of raising a
child in Singapore?

UPDATE: A reader pointed out that the [child vaccination should be ~40% cheaper
at a
Polyclinic](https://www.nhgp.com.sg/faq.aspx?id=720dda1c60b242a2999b475c0438ba78).
However after investigating, the major issue with this option is:

* needs to be booked (we were hoping to do a walk-in vaccination)
* booking people seem unsure of the fees (training issue perhaps)
* & **most importantly** child must be registered before with [National Immunisation Registry](https://www.nir.hpb.gov.sg/)

In [KKH](http://www.kkh.com.sg/) they told me over the phone they fax all
required particulars to the [NI Registry](https://www.nir.hpb.gov.sg/) on your
appointment date, so **no need** to register in advance. So as my reader
states: "As with all things Singapore, premiums are charged for dubiously
better/faster service."
