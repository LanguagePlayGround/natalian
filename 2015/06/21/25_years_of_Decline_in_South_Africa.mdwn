[[!meta description="Where I blame South Africa's constitution as a recipe for disaster. Think Animal farm but with more wiggle room."]]

25 years of "freedom", 25 years of decline. This [Telegraph
article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/southafrica/11684492/South-Africas-long-walk-to-decline.html)
put me in a reflective mood.

I was only a teenager when I witnessed things fall apart.

Armed with 25 years of hindsight of living abroad and watching South Africa
from afar, with just a couple of visits since we left... my thoughts are... **how things could have been different?**

If I could go back in time, be in a position of power, could anything be done
to have halt the decline of a place I once called home? What have we learnt over 25 years?

I think it's fair to say that the incumbent ANC government is corrupt and shows no sign of abating.

# A constitution without principle

Could South Africa's decline have been prevented? The "good intentions" were
there to prevent all sorts of issues in the making of the [South African
constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_South_Africa).
Unfortunately a bunch of people got together and banged out a tome of a [over
reaching and complex constitution](http://constitutionallyspeaking.co.za/bill-of-rights/).

As a minimalist, I much prefer the [US bill of
rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights)'s guiding
principles, but I guess that's no longer simple too.

From afar South African's justice system has waned. The [constitution has been
ignored](http://constitutionallyspeaking.co.za/al-bashir-flouting-court-orders-are-anti-poor-and-anti-democratic/).

The real problem is that the South African government has too much power, just
like the pigs in the [Animal Farm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm)
who rewrite the rules. I would like to please make a case for a small liberal
South African government.

# What if... SA was a small technocratic government like Singapore

I am no fan of the old "Apartheid" government. The South African state back
then employed a lot of people to win votes and the new post-apartheid
government inherited that dead weight, and sadly only added to it.

I distantly remember ANC election promises like "Free homes". A spectacularly
stupid idea that _still_ seems to be an ANC promise. How can you possibly
appreciate something without paying for it?

I believe "free homes" only keeps people lower class, poor and ever more
reliant on the government. On the other hand, if low cost housing were like HDBs in
Singapore, where people have to buy them and pay them off over a period of time...
things could be so different. I believe that when Thatcher gave the working class in
the UK the right to purchase their own social housing, it lifted them to the middle
class. The same phenomena happens all the time in Singapore.

The leading opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA) recently posted this video: [DA #VISION2029](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYBdF_CHBb8)

The video started well ... and then in my opinion it went down hill:

* police force, finally turning the tide
* improving education ... growth rate 8%
* growing the economy
* social welfare
* health care works for all
* government cares...

The DA's vision is that it helps South Africans, in much the same way ANC does.
A policy that does not work!

# [Libertarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Libertarianism) could be the vision

Speaking to South Africans, what I hear does work is private security, private
education, private healthcare, private companies.

What doesn't work? The South African government.

Can the South African government be cut down and privatised? With strong
property rights and a small government that gets the hell out the way of
business?

I can only dream.
