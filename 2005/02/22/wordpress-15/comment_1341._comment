<p>About that poker/sex shit and the poker club .. I&#8217;m sure you have already known taht you can plug a plugin into your wordpress, they work great. I myself use Spam Karma (use google or browse the plugin section on wordpress.org). It&#8217;s pretty nice, the installationis staright froward, and it blocks the spams for me, silenty .. a personal spam assasin, just for you and your blog :D .. happy maintaining WP for Debian ..</p>

<p>Uh oh, Spaminator is another alternative (used by default on blogthing.com)</p>
