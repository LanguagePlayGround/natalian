<p>I had trouble reading my mail and you might as well had trouble accessing this site. Evidently <a href="http://blog.dreamhost.com/2005/12/12/massive-ddos-attack/">Dreamhost was dealing with a distributed denial of service attack.</a></p>

<p>I liked the way they updated their <a href="http://status.dreamhost.com/">status page</a> humourously. Some other admins would have been <a href="http://www.grc.com">hopping mad.</a></p>

<p>I don&#8217;t run anything too critical on Dreamhost. Though I often suggest companies outsource their mail to them. So if I was using Dreamhost for managing a company&#8217;s IT needs, the company&#8217;s email et al would have been out of action for half the day.</p>
