<p>I agree, that&#8217;s the exact reason I switched my desktop to Ubuntu. I still miss running sid, but finding the time when I feel up to updating and praying nothing breaks too badly became too much of a chore. I know it&#8217;s unstable, I just hate when I&#8217;m hit with a &#8220;known&#8221; issue which I would have &#8220;known&#8221; about too if I&#8217;d searched 500 different places first&#8230; The wiki would be an ideal place for this info, imho.</p>
