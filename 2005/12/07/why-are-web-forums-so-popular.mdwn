[[!tag web forums Debian]]

* Web forums can be indexed by Google and hence show up in search results
* Web forum sysops can easily decorate a forum as they please, creating a little more personality than an average mailing list
* Forums often have fine controls in how posts as seen to the outside world
* Forums are easier to moderate - UI in place for banning IPs etc.
* Forums generally have a better community feel
* Generally have DB backend, making it easier to do queries to see how many posts a certain user has made etc.
* Instant gratification - you can confirm your post is live

Mailing list problems:

* Hard to subscribe
* Sometimes difficult to confirm your post actually was posted
* Cliquey atmosphere
* Often no public archives or poor Web archives

If you're a fan like myself of email, please consider taking up a project to

system](http://suckless.org/project_ideas).
