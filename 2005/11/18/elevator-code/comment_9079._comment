<p>In the early 90s when fuzzy logic was <strong>the</strong> buzzword of control engineering, I saw a (Finnish) documentary about elevators that use fuzzy rules for decision making logic in the future.</p>

<p>So the elevator could have thought like &#8220;ok, it&#8217;s pretty late friday afternoonish now and I&#8217;m heading quite fast downwards with a semi-heavy load, so maybe I&#8217;ll pick up Kai later on&#8221; ;-)</p>
