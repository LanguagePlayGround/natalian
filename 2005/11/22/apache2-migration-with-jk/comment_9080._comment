<p>I&#8217;ve been using apache + tomcat setup in production for few years now. Actually the best result of stability and speed I have got, not using mod-jk* at all. I&#8217;m using apache&#8217;s  own Proxy implementation.. Like this:</p>

<p>proxypass /img/ !<br />
 proxypass / http://localhost:8000/software/<br />
 proxypassreverse / http://localhost:8000/software/</p>

<p>or something like that..</p>

<p>It&#8217;s fast.. and it works great =) actually, with a little mod rewrite, you can actually make RoundRobin load balansing too..</p>
