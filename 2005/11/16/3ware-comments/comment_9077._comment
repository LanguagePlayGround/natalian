<p>Run this /sbin/blockdev&#8212;setra 4096 /dev/sda and have it run at boot time.</p>

<p>And then:</p>

<p>hdparm -tT /dev/sda</p>

<p>/dev/sda:<br />
 Timing cached reads:   3420 MB in  2.00 seconds = 1708.55 MB/sec<br />
 Timing buffered disk reads:  570 MB in  3.00 seconds = 189.84 MB/sec</p>

<p>You should get disk reads of about 80MB/s with <span class="caps">RAID</span>-1.</p>
