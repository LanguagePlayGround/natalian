<p>haha.  Yeah, I was in that situation a while back.  I&#8217;m really suprised how loud they make those server chassis.  In the end, someone i worked with had an ego complex and enjoyed living around the servers (something about power) so we moved the servers closer to him.  He loved it.  (think the boss from &#8220;The Office&#8221;)</p>

<p>but they are loud.</p>
