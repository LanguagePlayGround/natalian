<p>You can disable HashKnownHosts. If you think there&#8217;s a small chance of your machine being taken over by some automated tool, then HashKnownHosts seems like a lot of pain for not much gain. When the hosts are hashed, it&#8217;s impossible to use tab completion on hostnames. Since I use that completion quite a lot, I find HashKnownHosts to be more of a nuisance than it&#8217;s worth.</p>
