<p>I had no clue about and never used JBoss. Today I was surfing around to find out what it&#8217;s all about. I&#8217;ve surfed to JBoss website and I have to agree, the documentation sucks (big time).</p>

<p>First of all, I was required to login to read the documentation (what&#8217;s with that? don&#8217;t they want me to know what it is?). So I went to bugmenot.com and get a login and a password. Then after browsing the documentation for a while, I still couldn&#8217;t figure out what it is other than that it is an application server and it has something to do with Java. I went to the wiki and the forum (or at least I tried to). There was no link to anything like &#8216;What is JBoss&#8217; or &#8216;Overview&#8217; or &#8216;New to JBoss&#8217;.</p>

<p>I typed &#8216;What is JBoss&#8217; in google and after few pages, I still didn&#8217;t know what it is. I still don&#8217;t quite know what it is.</p>
