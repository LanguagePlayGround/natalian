<p>Yes I&#8217;ve got as far now as bothering to install just the client and using:</p>

<p>dict -h dict.org qualm</p>

<p>Though I wish it was a little faster in the sense there a local dictionary server, au.dict.org</p>

<p>Moby Thesaurus on <a href="http://www.dict.org/bin/Dict?Form=Dict4">http://www.dict.org/bin/Dict?Form=Dict4</a> is satisfactory.</p>
