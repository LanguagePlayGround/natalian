<p>OK, I&#8217;ve got to ask&#8212;I don&#8217;t work for Microsoft (I&#8217;m just a consultant)&#8212;but unless you don&#8217;t own your Windows software, why on Earth would you not be OK with a Validation Check? Are you worried that they&#8217;ll &#8220;steal&#8221; information from you?</p>

<p>You make it sound as if Microsoft should not do &#8220;anything&#8221; about the zillions of pirated copies of Windows&#8212;validation does <span class="caps">NOT</span> send them information about you, or your software. So like I said&#8212;&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
