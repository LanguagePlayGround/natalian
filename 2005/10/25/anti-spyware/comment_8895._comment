<p>Dear Blake,</p>

<p>Yes I am concerned they will &#8220;steal information from me&#8221;. I like to be anonymous whilst surfing the Internet.</p>

<p>More importantly: It is just not sensible to download an .exe and run it. Maybe I&#8217;ve been using Debian too long. :)</p>

<p>I have been trying to update a Win2k machine at work. <span class="caps">OMG</span>. It never works like it should. Format and re-install!</p>

<p>Those pirates do Microsoft a favour in my opinion. If you&#8217;re not forced to buy a copy of Microsoft when you buy a machine, your local dork will offer you the warez. :/</p>
