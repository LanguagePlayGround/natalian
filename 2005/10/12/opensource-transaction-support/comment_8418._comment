<p>Thank you for your comments Joose.</p>

<p>In future I will try Postgres again and try shake off my previous experiences.</p>

<p>The problems I&#8217;ve had with &#8220;REAL <span class="caps">SQL</span> <span class="caps">SERVERS</span>&#8221; is generally from a <span class="caps">DBA</span> <span class="caps">POV</span>. Oracle is a <span class="caps">NIGHTMARE</span> to administrate. I&#8217;ve had similar though far less brain damaging experiences with PostgresSQL, though that was years ago now.</p>

<p>Despite your valid complaints, I&#8217;m still a mysql fanboy. ;)</p>
