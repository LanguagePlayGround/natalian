<p>You should really buy osx computer and give it a try =)</p>

<p>OS X (tiger) has very good picture viewing capabilities and also very good dial up too has been in every osx I&#8217;ve used. I use it to go to Internet when i&#8217;m on road (powerbook  nokiainternet). Everything was very easy to set up.</p>

<p>Linux is good for server environment, but for desktop use, it has a long way to go. OS X is something what Linux should be (in desktop usuability at least).</p>
