<p>hi,</p>

<p>accessing the nano is quite easy. First off, you use it like a usb mass storage device,<br />
over here, /dev/sda2 contains the data. Then there are a bunch of tools you can use to<br />
manage your playlists and iTunes Database (gtkpod for X, gnupod-tools for command line<br />
and several perl libraries like Mac::Ipod::Gnupod if you want to hack your own).</p>
