<p>OpenOffice is a good try, but isn&#8217;t there yet to be replacement for MS Office in the corpote world. .DOC format is de facto standard and OOo is like 95% there. Also, OOo in Mac is dead slow, so Mac users choose MS Office over OOo.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t tried the latest version, but like adding page numbers to pages was way too difficult job in OOo for average Joes. In MS Word, it&#8217;s like &#8220;insert -&gt; page numbers&#8221; .. in OOo it requires little bit more work. So, average Joes prefer MS Office over OOo <br />
because it&#8217;s easier to use to them (and I have had many test subjects =) )</p>

<p>Web based softwares are the future, just need good technologies to do those.</p>

<p>Just my 2 cents, Joose</p>
