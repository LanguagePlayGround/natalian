<p>U R lucky that U were in Havelock. U havn&#8217;nt seen the sea waves .Even if u have seen it was the after effect.<br />
The beaches, harbours, residents etc are in the western coast. <br />
Even the neil Island harbour( jetty) is in northern part. It is least affected.<br />
Tourist are most stationed in the western coast.where tsunami is not at all affected.<br />
U R <span class="caps">LUCKY</span><br />
Once again cone to neil Island and visit sitapur beach ( east cost) U will definetly find the difference &#8221; the unbeleivable defference&#8221; ( if u have visited the eastern coast of neil Island before tsunami) <br />
