<p>I am working for an Australian company that makes software for Airlines, called <a href="http://soltecsoftware.com.au/">Soltec Software</a>.</p>

<p>I recall starting my degree and learning about the stereotypical case for complex software being Airline software. Here I am, first job armed with a degree doing just that.</p>
