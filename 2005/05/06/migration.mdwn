<p>I am migrating my data from Finland to the UK from Bangkok and everything is a bit of a mess now.</p>

<p>I have updated the <a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/hendry/debian/">maradns package</a> which should <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=307662">fix a security issue.</a></p>

<p>I have updated the <a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/hendry/debian/">wordpress package</a> to allow multiple installations. It could do with some more testing and feedback.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I will be in Melbourne searching for a job.</p>
