<p>I&#8217;m not too sure that enforcing the upgrade to Apache2 is a good idea, even if you mandate the use of mod_security.</p>

<p>After all a non-clueful administrator is likely to be missing the necessary rules to protect their server.</p>

<p>I briefly wrote an introduction to mod-security &#8211; but as has been said in many places without a good set of rules mod-security is giving a false impression of security and doing little active good.</p>
