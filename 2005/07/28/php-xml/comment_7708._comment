<p>Hi Kai,</p>

<p><span class="caps">PHP</span> 4 and <span class="caps">XML</span> is pretty bad in that you have to choose a particular setup and lots of stuff is not in the default install, but there are some libraries out there that can help &#8211; this one would have been used by me in my latest project but for the fact that I just took the plunge with <span class="caps">PHP</span> 5. It&#8217;s called MiniXML and can be used in Perl too.</p>

<p><a href="http://minixml.psychogenic.com/">http://minixml.psychogenic.com/</a></p>

<p>they have a good amount of docs too.</p>

<p>hope this is of use,</p>

<p>Luke</p>
