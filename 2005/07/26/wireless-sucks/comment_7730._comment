<p>free internet is a dream that will never be realized because none of the freeloading bums that want it dont realize how much it would cost to give useable speed to every single person in their neighborhood(sp?) and for you folks who say &#8220;it ain&#8217;t that much&#8221; (hendry) look at the secound serious sentance in your post (most people who steal internet don&#8217;t care about whether or not they are &#8220;hogging the pipe&#8221; the use and go and booting them can waste your time and be annoying) also this can be dangerous because you could probably download child porn or bomb-making stuff (or even stuff from political parties you don&#8217;t like) using your bandwith</p>
