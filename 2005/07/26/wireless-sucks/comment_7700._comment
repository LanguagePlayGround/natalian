<p>I want free Wireless Internet dammit. When I try the forums, mailing lists and irc channels people accuse me of aiming to “steal the Internet”. Oh <span class="caps">FFS</span>. The Internet should be free assholes.</p>

<p>They are right. <span class="caps">YOU</span> are wrong. Please stop smoking crack.</p>

<p>You are taking a <span class="caps">VERY</span> dangerous though path. Someone paid for setting up the wifi access point and internet connection to it. Why should <span class="caps">YOU</span> get that free? Maybe you deserve free internet hosting as well? Just that those asshole system admins make the hosting servers too hard to crack into&#8230;</p>
