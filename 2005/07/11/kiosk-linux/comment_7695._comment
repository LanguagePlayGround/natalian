<p>The old Netscape use to take it&#8217;s profile data from <span class="caps">LDAP</span>, so I&#8217;d be surprised if it didn&#8217;t do this.</p>

<p>Are you sure!</p>

<p>The Netscape site use to include all the schema information you needed, but if you bought the Netscape^W IPlanet server it would &#8220;Just work&#8221;.</p>

<p>But yes <span class="caps">NFS</span> would work, anything that pretends to be a filesystem could store the current directories (WebDav, <span class="caps">SSH</span>), although that might raise issues if you ever went back a version.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been playing with moving Bookmarks, and related information via Webdav, for which there are extensions.</p>
