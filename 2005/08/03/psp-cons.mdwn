<ul>
<li>Short battery life compared to a mobile phone. 3&#8211;4hrs to what, 24 hours nowadays at least?</li>
<li>It&#8217;s not a mobile phone. So you can&#8217;t make phone calls, so I find it hard to imagine myself with two hunks of plastic in my pockets.</li>
<li>UMDs suck. They spin. They break. They&#8217;re shitty proprietary technology.</li>
<li>Firmware upgrade issues. Version 2 has the browser but is more restrictive</li>
<li>Memory sticks are atm maximum 2G. 1G currently cost a fortune here in Australia. Almost 300AUD!</li>
<li>Not sure about the support for Linux and generic <span class="caps">USB</span> storage. No way am I using win32.</li>
<li>I heard the software for mp3 playback has annoying bugs.</li>
