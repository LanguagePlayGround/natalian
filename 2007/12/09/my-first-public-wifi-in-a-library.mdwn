<p>Since my girlfriend&#8217;s <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/hendry/sets/72157603410512600/">Virgin Internet stopped working</a>, I was in need of <a href="http://natalian.org/archives/2007/05/09/east-london-wifi/">Free <span class="caps">WIFI</span></a> in London again this weekend.</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/2097659240/" title="Peckham library WIFI by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2172/2097659240_0003feefe1_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Peckham library WIFI" /></a>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised to see that <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/YourServices/LibrariesSection/freewifihotspotsinlibraries.html">Southwark council offer Free <span class="caps">WIFI</span></a>! It was a little slow for my taste and it forces you to do a stupid registration, though it worked! This is a milestone. Especially since I have campaigned for <span class="caps">WIFI</span> in countless libraries, yet only now in London 2007, I&#8217;ve experience public Internet access. Wonderful.</p>

<p>It was also cool to bump into <a href="http://talkaoke.com/">talkaoke</a> at <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/YourServices/LibrariesSection/LibrariesLocationsSection/peckhamlibrary.html">Peckham library</a>. :)</p>
