<p>First I still think Britain should have <a href="http://natalian.org/archives/2007/03/29/say-sorry/">apologised</a> over this <a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Category:2007_Iranian_seizure_of_Royal_Navy_personnel">Iranian seizure of Royal Navy personnel</a> incident.</p>

<p>Now I think it is time to say &#8220;Thank you&#8221;. Honestly, it was embarrassing to catch the headlines of <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2007150662,00.html">The Sun with &#8220;I went to Iran and all I got was this lousy suit&#8221;</a>. Please! And the Daily Mirror also dangerously refers to the 15 as <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/tm_headline=hostages-arrive-in-uk%26method=full%26objectid=18862840%26siteid=89520-name_page.html">hostages</a>.</p>

<p>Disgraceful red top tabloids. I apologise for our awful tabloid press and <strong>thank you</strong> Iran for releasing the 15. I think it is fantastic that we&#8217;ve reached a peaceful conclusion and lets get to know each other better.</p>

<p>Update: Even the <a href="http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/"><span class="caps">WMN</span></a> refers to them as hostages. I&#8217;m not too impressed with the Telegraph coverage either. Disappointing. :/</p>
