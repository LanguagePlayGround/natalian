<p>Kai, 3 and 4 are not too expensive. They are the only approach that deliver the results expected by the companies who pay to have their mobile sites built.<br />
I have a question for you. please answer honestly. Have you ever built a mobile site for a paying customer?<br />
wrt Opera, it will work very well as long as you serve it links, text and a picture here or there. But try anything more complicated and you will see that Opera is implemented very inconsistently across dvices and their <span class="caps">CSS</span> media queries support only help in demos&#8230;</p>
