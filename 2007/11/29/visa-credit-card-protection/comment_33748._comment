<p>I don&#8217;t mind the <span class="caps">PIN</span> sentry device. I&#8217;ve used one on my Dutch account for the past eight years, and the only problem I&#8217;ve had with it was when it started malfunctioning last September with me out of the country; and even then they were quick to send me a new one. But I understand your mobility concerns. In Iceland, they have just introduced a device the size of a <span class="caps">USB</span> disk that comes with a keyring; that ought to do the trick for you, although it is perhaps less secure in not requiring a card. At Nordea in Finland I didn&#8217;t feel that the list of one-time codes was a particularly advanced solution; and I would sooner lose or damage a list like that than my little sentry device. My Canadian bank just works with a password, that doesn&#8217;t seem particularly clever, and it strikes me as an odd contrast with the Orwellian suspicion of <span class="caps">VISA</span> Canada.</p>
