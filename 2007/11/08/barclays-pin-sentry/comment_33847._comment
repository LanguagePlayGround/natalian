<p>Whatever you do, DO <span class="caps">NOT</span> get one of these pin sentry card readers unless you&#8217;ve got a debit card. I&#8217;ve just phoned up to get the Authentication card the website tells me I can have. After half an hour of being put on hold, transferred three times to different departments, I finally reached someone who got the gist of what I was saying, who then told me I needed to be transferred to another department which closed 15 minutes ago.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m gonna go kick the cat&#8230;.</p>
