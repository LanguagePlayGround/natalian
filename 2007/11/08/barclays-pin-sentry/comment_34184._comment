<p>I have a joint account with my wife. She can use <span class="caps">PIN</span> Sentry as she has the new connect card (bright blue). I have the older (dark blue) card and cannot use <span class="caps">PIN</span> sentry. I use online banking with my business both at Lloyds and Natwest and both are easier to use. We have opened a new joint account with Lloyds, with a tracker savings account linked in and we are weaning ourselves off Barclays.</p>

<p>It is a cumbersome method of doing random key creation. Some French banks have an on-line version, which saves carrying yet another device, which can be lost or stolen and thereefore cloned or fraudulently used.</p>
