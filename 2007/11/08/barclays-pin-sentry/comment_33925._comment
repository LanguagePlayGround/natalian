<p>What is everyone&#8217;s problem?! If you haven&#8217;t got your card ready on you then just click on the &#8216;not got card reader&#8217; link and it still lets you into your online banking. You can&#8217;t transfer money out of your accounts but it means you don&#8217;t have to carry your card reader with you. I take mine to work every day and keep it in my pocket, it&#8217;s really not that big!</p>
