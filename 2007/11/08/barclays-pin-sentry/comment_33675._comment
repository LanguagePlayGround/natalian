<p>This happened to a couple of friends of mine who are in Asia atm. They had two bank accounts, one with barclays. The other got taken over and so a new card was issued, the other bank was barclays and apparently was specifically chosen for a &#8220;pin-sentry&#8221; because of their &#8220;suspicious&#8221; activity, ie, taking money out in lots of different countries.</p>
