<p>My dad is even worse than yours with the computer. My dad, 56, types with one finger and still needs me to help him to search the net and to attach documents to the e-mail. He hardly uses the computer because he&#8217;d rather putter around in the basement.  I think that his lack of typing skills also keeps him away from the computer.  our parents need help!</p>
