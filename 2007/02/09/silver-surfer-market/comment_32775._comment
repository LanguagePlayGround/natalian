<p>My parents don&#8217;t have problems using their computer. Neather of my parents understand english.</p>

<p>They can move photos from camera to computer. They can send photos in email in decent size (reducing the size). They can call video conference calls. They know how to print/scan&#8230; etc.. And I have not teached them nor I have had to help many times (2 times in last 4 years). They even managed to install scanner and printer without problems.</p>

<p>My parents have a mac and they like it =)</p>
