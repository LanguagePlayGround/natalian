<p>I think that you are being a bit rough on this org. You are right that they are seeking donations, but isn&#8217;t everyone looking for some more money?  As far as the turning off your computer at the end of the day, I think that is a good a idea. If you&#8217;re not going to use it while you&#8217;re sleeping, then turn it off and save a little electricity.  I doubt that just because of this ad that there are going to be a lot of parents who are on their children&#8217;s cases to use their computers less.</p>
