<p>Yeah&#8230;</p>

<p>The real problem isn&#8217;t really the batteries, it&#8217;s the mains supply. To charge a Canon battery I have to take it out of the camera and find the right charger and often the right adaptor to begin charging it.</p>

<p>If they could just use a mini-USB interface with the battery inside charging it would be far more inconvenient.</p>

<p>One big problem with batteries is there lifetime. What happens when this battery starts to fail? Canon makes so many different sorts of batteries, will able to get a replacement long into the future? I think not!</p>

<p>Anyway Canon you should really try clean up their act. They have great point&amp;shoot cameras, though there are really letting themselves down with a poor <span class="caps">USB</span> interface and other crap like their software they ship with it.</p>
