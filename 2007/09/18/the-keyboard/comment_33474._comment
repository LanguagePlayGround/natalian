<p>NX7000 series (do they still exist ?) have page up/down stacked vertivally, exactly at the place where they are on your X40. So you probably could find a HP Compaq whose keyboard suits you. They may have those &#8220;dead keys&#8221; though, but I personally like them because I don&#8217;t risk pressing a rogue key while I frantically use the arrow keys (think frozen bubble)</p>
