<p>Hello Kai,<br />
Thanks for sending me the link to your blog. I would like to note that the only reason we changed the power supply is because we needed to make the switch eventually to handle the ever-increasing power demands of notebooks. The move from 16V to 20V would allow us to serve greater power needs and if you haven&#8217;t kept up with the particulars, notebook power demands sure are increasing.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sorry to hear your 1.8&#8221; drive crashed, hopefully the replacement will last you longer. If you&#8217;re not under warranty, most new drives carry decent-length warranties from the manufacturer &#8211; just keep your data backed up! ;)</p>
