<p>Oh, and another thing. You can buy &#8220;gifts&#8221; for people on facebook. At first I was like, what the hell, these things aren&#8217;t real, what a rip off! But now I think it&#8217;s actually quite a good business model, it&#8217;s a way that people can donate and pay for the site, but kinda get something for their money too, and they&#8217;re only U$1 a pop.</p>
