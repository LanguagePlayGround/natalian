<p>I think you have to separate your web standards ideals from the user experience. Users don&#8217;t give a shit. Just because it&#8217;s somehow standards complient does not make it a good site. And why are you propergating this myth that the web is dangerous? If someone wants to know your address they can just look it up on the voter register or the phone book. The internet is not <span class="caps">REAL</span>, nobody can travel down the phone line and kill you.</p>
