<p>Would you say the user experience of email is better or worse than say IM-ing?</p>

<p>Email uses standards, whilst IM is that very poor user experience of proprietary islands. I&#8217;d rather use standards and communicate via email, instead of <span class="caps">MSN</span> Live or whatever it calls itself now.</p>

<p>Oh no, we are going to get into this, &#8220;what&#8217;s there to fear debate?&#8221;</p>

<p>What is there to fear if you&#8217;re watched everywhere by <span class="caps">CCTV</span>? Where anyone everywhere knows where you are? It could have Orwellian consequences.</p>
