<p>Ok,</p>

<p>a) Orkut has been and <span class="caps">GONE</span>? You&#8217;ve been to India and Brazil, <span class="caps">HELLO</span>???<br />
b) you are paranoid<br />
c) generally I am not a fan either, but facebook is quite fun, and to me it does seem kinda new, the individual parts aren&#8217;t new, obviously, message boards, photo sharing etc, but put it all together in one very neat package and you do have something that at least seems new, I&#8217;ve joined all the others, to try and perhaps to have a presence, but facebook is the first one I&#8217;d say that I am into, and for me it&#8217;s not about meeting people, all my &#8220;friends&#8221; on there I know in real life, <br />
d) you are paranoid<br />
e) don&#8217;t slate it until you&#8217;ve tried it<br />
f) yes, you guessed it, you are paranoid, but I suppose that doesn&#8217;t mean that they aren&#8217;t out to steal your data</p>
