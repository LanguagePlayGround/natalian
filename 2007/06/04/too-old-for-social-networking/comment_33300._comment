<p>So User A on <span class="caps">MSN</span> wants to speak to User B on <span class="caps">ICQ</span>. <span class="caps">GREEEAATT</span> &#8220;user experience&#8221;.</p>

<p>Users prefer the Web. It&#8217;s not &#8216;Linux&#8217;, it&#8217;s the Web. The Web wins over Windows without it being forced down people&#8217;s throats or having to pay any M$ tax. Open standards are fantastic.</p>
