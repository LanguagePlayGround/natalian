<p>Trip involved a lot of waiting. I arrived too early at London City Airport. It was really easy to get to from Tower Hamlets, so there are some advantages living in East London. Since I am of Scottish ancestry and it is the first time I am in Scotland, I was almost hoping for some welcoming party. Sadly, nothing of the sort and I ended up waiting at Edinburgh Airport for another DD, however his plane was late. Thankfully I discovered the multi-denominational &#8220;Prayer room&#8221;.</p>

<p>After visiting some amazing mosques on my travels, I know it is quite permissible to go in a Islamic mosque and take a little nap, which I did. I wish they made Christian churches a little more comfortable in that respect. Laying down on the floor of a typical Western church and admiring the architecture would probably be bad for one&#8217;s health.</p>

<p>Ok, I&#8217;ve started tagging <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/debconf7/">debconf7</a> on my flickr uploads during my time here. I wonder if <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aigarius/">Aigars</a> will do the same. ;)</p>

<p>Edinburgh reminds me a little like Calcutta, with the soot stained buildings. Teviot house where the debcampers are is a great building. Up the road near a mosque was a cheap Indian eatery. I had a great chicken curry, nan and pakora. Fantastic.</p>
