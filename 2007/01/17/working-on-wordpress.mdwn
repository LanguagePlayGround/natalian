<p>I am keeping a close eye on the <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2007/01/wordpress-207/">Wordpress 2.0.7 release</a>.</p>

<p>I am being cautious because:</p>

<ol>
<li>no pings on their post. bit odd!</li>
<li>The mentioned <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/407116">vulnerability does not apply to Debian&#8217;s <span class="caps">PHP</span></a></li>
<li>The diff between 2.0.6 and 2.0.7 has some considerable changes to the Akismet plugin which is not mentioned on the changelog/post</li>
<li>I would like to improve the Debian copyright file, though I would like to hear back from upstream first</li>
<li>There seems to be <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=407289">another minor security bug which I don&#8217;t think 2.0.7 addresses</a></li>
</ol>

<p>I am also keeping an eye on <a href="http://natalian.org/archives/2006/12/11/wordpress-mu/">Wordpress MU</a> edition, to see how they handle these bugs, which has been version 1.0 for sometime.</p>

<p>Update: Ryan informs me there will be a 2.0.8 fixing the last reported security bug.</p>
