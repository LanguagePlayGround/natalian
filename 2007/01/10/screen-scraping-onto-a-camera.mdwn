<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be cool if I could:</p>

<ol>
<li>take a rendered Web page</li>
<li>convert it to <span class="caps">JPEG</span></li>
<li>upload it to my digital camera (wirelessly)</li>
</ol>

<p>So I could view the page on my digital camera, which is usually very apt for viewing images&#8230; compared to my <a href="http://natalian.org/archives/2007/01/13/nokia-2610/">crap mobile phone</a>.</p>

<p>Or it would be great to have a fecking usable web browser in a mobile phone that doesn&#8217;t cost a fortune.</p>

<p>Instead as you can see from the screenshot. I just took a picture of my X40&#8217;s screen. :)</p>

<p>To conclude ideally the Canon&#8217;s transfer interface needs improving. Sometimes when I manipulate a <span class="caps">JPEG</span> and put the SD card back into the camera, Canon seems to think the <span class="caps">JPEG</span> is now incompatible.</p>
