<p>Hehe ;-)</p>

<p>The web in 10 years time is going to be massively mobile and it&#8217;s going to be significantly different to today&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8230;in many ways, but particularly in the way that it will cater for mobile as a first-class context. I doubt much of the web will be designed solely for lonely folks sitting at big screens with lots of time on their hands.</p>

<p>Get out of your chair, walk about, but still be online &#8211; while you get on, efficiently, with the rest of your life!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll see you then, and we will see who was right :-)</p>
