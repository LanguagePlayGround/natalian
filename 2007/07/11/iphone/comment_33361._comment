<p>&#8220;A decent implementation of Web standards&#8221;. It is. I agree.</p>

<p>But why do you think they chose to write a developer guide?</p>

<p>In fact, their vibe is very similar to the stance taken by W3C and dotMobi: &#8220;It&#8217;s the web, but not exactly as you know it. Don&#8217;t go crazy&#8221;.</p>

<p>(By the way, the .mobi guidelines <strong>are</strong> W3C/web standards)</p>

<p>Since many other browsers are this good, and the .mobi <span class="caps">TLD</span> is primarily is about indicating user context anyway, your arguments about browser capabilities seem a bit old-fashioned.</p>

<p>I think we&#8217;ve been through this many times though :-)</p>
