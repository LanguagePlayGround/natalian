<p>Ebuyer&#8217;s entirely open about &#8220;drop shipping&#8221; . I suppose they must be advertising their suppliers&#8217; stocks of products for which they do this. I&#8217;ve also seen delayed next-day shipping rather than dispatch via a slow service. Perhaps the price grades are there because they can batch up less urgent orders to get discounts from their suppliers, rather than on delivery?</p>
