<p>Since this blog is on Planet Debian and should have a large audience, I want to make one thing clear&#8212;VeraSansYuanTi is such a blatant theft that should never be mentioned in a positive light.</p>

<p>Note I didn&#8217;t say non-free, and I didn&#8217;t say pirate, but theft.  Somebody took the Chinese glyphs out of a Chinese proprietary font by Founder (<a href="http://www.founder.com/eindex/eindex.asp">http://www.founder.com/eindex/eindex.asp</a>), stripped out the copyright information, added the English glyphs from Bitstream Vera, and shamelessly started to distribute it under a different name.</p>

<p>I hope everybody can become aware of this, and hopefully eventually nobody will distribute it anymore.</p>
