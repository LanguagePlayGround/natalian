<p>I don&#8217;t think you can expect all TV to be good, and I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s any different now than it&#8217;s ever been, though maybe the <span class="caps">BBC</span> have to compete with even more cheap crap TV now, not sure why they bother, ratings, ratings, ratings. But surely there is some good TV out there, how was that investigation into scientology? Some of the <span class="caps">BBC</span> dramas must be good too, and there&#8217;s always some decent documentries&#8230;</p>
