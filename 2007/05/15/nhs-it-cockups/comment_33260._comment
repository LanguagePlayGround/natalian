<p>1&gt; The nation is not watching Channel 4 news at 7 because it doesn&#8217;t have Natasha Nijinsky or Ulrika &#8216;what a shock I&#8217;m a sex addict&#8217; Jonsson presenting it.</p>

<p>2&gt; I&#8217;m not sure about the whole public purse-open source argument otherwise when the <span class="caps">NHS</span> pays for you to have another syphilis test the results would have to be made available to anyone with a tax return ;)</p>

<p>3&gt; The biggest cock-up with the <span class="caps">NHS</span> IT systems seems to me to be the governments inability to make its mind up. Some general practices had perfectly good IT systems then were told they had to change them to government authorised suppliers, so signed up to expensive new contracts for systems worse then they had, then were told that they could keep the original, newly authorised systems (which they still had 6 months after it was supposed to have changed as the new software wasn&#8217;t ready), but couldn&#8217;t get out of the contract they had only signed under duress in the first place. Trying then to implement a coordinated network (NHS <span class="caps">SPINE</span> methinks) without any foundations in place seems crazy &#8211; mind you it probably serves the purpose of meeting some manifesto pledge or election target somewhere even if it doesn&#8217;t work. Throw in the consultant contract fiasco and the doctor training scheme mess and you could be forgiven for thinking that the government isn&#8217;t very fond of doctors.</p>
