<p>Kai, you are not going to get an indepth IT discussion on channel 4 news, who&#8217;s watching? Who would watch? :) Pertricia Hewitte is there as the head of the <span class="caps">NHS</span>, and you can&#8217;t expect her to be an expert on IT, but she should be well enough informed to answer all the questions that a well informed interviewer might ask.</p>
