<p>anyone know how the branding affects the phone, as compared with a <span class="caps">SIM</span>-free e65? and is the browser still the proprietery nokia browser?<br />
try doing a hard reset but remember to save all your favorite things onto your memory card before you do.</p>

<p>Way cool phone though</p>
