<p>I was referring to &#8216;MBA&#8217; Asia as in the huge Indian and Chinese markets. Btw I used to work for Access Japan, so (I like to think) I have quite a good idea what actually happens. ;)</p>

<p>I do find your &#8220;lot of people happily using the web on phones right now&#8221; difficult to apply in countries like China&amp;India. Though you are the Google guy, master of all information. :)</p>

<p>Gmail is a cutting edge Web application, which won&#8217;t work on most people&#8217;s crappy browsers I admit! I can&#8217;t give you a better answer, than to push for good <span class="caps">HTML</span> &#8216;Web capable&#8217; browser requirements and hopefully this won&#8217;t be a problem. Anyhoo I guess your Java client can &#8220;bridge the gap&#8221; for now, eh?</p>

<p>And I&#8217;ll have to disagree with you about the mobile Web. If people are stuck in the <span class="caps">XHTML</span> MP (or worse <span class="caps">WAP</span>) mindset, it really hinders the roll out of &#8216;Web capable&#8217; devices. That&#8217;s my experience and UK&#8217;s three.co.uk recent choosing of the &#8220;Services&#8221; browser over the Webkit Nokia &#8216;Web&#8217; browser is a concrete example of a <strong>screw up</strong> of this mindset.</p>

<p>If you think by creating <span class="caps">XHTML</span> Mobile Web search you are unleashing a world of valuable information into markets like India&amp;China, I think you must be kidding yourself. China&amp;India are very much part of the world without your Mobile Web&#8482;. Internet cafes out there are everywhere and cheap.</p>

<p>The first result is my CV. Maybe you are using the Mobile version which is different to my desktop rendering of the <span class="caps">XHTML</span>??  :P</p>
