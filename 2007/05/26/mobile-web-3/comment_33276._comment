<p>I am super-happy for a <strong>browser based</strong> mobile context, like <span class="caps">CSS</span> media types. Lets be clear about this.</p>

<p>Yes, support for the &#8216;Mobile Web&#8217; will promote device dependent authoring and hence &#8216;harm&#8217; with the current confusion reigning the day.</p>

<p>You might not now have a <span class="caps">GPRS</span> network and a decent &#8216;Web capable&#8217; mobile, but <strong>you will have</strong>. I am not being elitist here. I do not want exclusion, I want the one Web!</p>

<p>Also in the short term if you think there are billions of Asians going to use your <span class="caps">XHTML</span> MP &#8216;mobile web&#8217; services, I think you need to go over there and have a look for your self. I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll ever reach this <span class="caps">MBA</span>&#8216;s wet dream.</p>

<p>Your Gmail question? A compelling Web app for any device right now? I&#8217;m lost. Just repeat the question. :)</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.google.com/m/search?mrestrict=xhtml&amp;q=Kai+Hendry&amp;btnG=Search&amp;site=mobile" rel="nofollow">links</a> are all about me I think. Though they suck. Honestly. Only my CV link might be useful. What about my <a href="http://hendry.iki.fi/" rel="nofollow">homepage</a> with my mobile number?</p>

<p>Once again, you think I require 500USD from every developing world citizen before they get the Web? <span class="caps">LOL</span>! They will get the Web, when their mobiles and networks evolve to be &#8216;Web capable&#8217; in time. The non-exclusive Universal Web will take <strong>a longer time</strong> to be realised if you push this &#8216;XHTML MP Mobile Web&#8217;.</p>
