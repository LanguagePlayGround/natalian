<p>You are arguing against the mobile context entirely then. No browser can change the fact that you are browsing on a postage stamp, 10 keys, and dial-up-modem network speeds. Yes, this is a &#8220;crap&#8221; platform for accessing the Web. It not simply quantitatively different from the desktop experience, it&#8217;s qualitatively different. If you think bringing any internet service to these devices is a waste of time, OK, I think that&#8217;s actually a defensible position.</p>

<p>Does the Mobile Web harm anything? you&#8217;re saying that by making tiny pages, nobody&#8217;s incentivized to make a browser that handles bigger pages. I just think this is false. How about Opera Mini? Nokia&#8217;s Communicator? iPhone? I see nothing but a scramble to get something like a desktop experience onto something in your pocket. So no, the world of &#8220;crap browsers&#8221; seems to be going away on schedule.</p>

<p>Yes this is where mobile web access is headed. The Mobile Web is hopefully gone as a distinct thing in 5 years. But what now? I just don&#8217;t see the harm, aside from some theoretical point, in producing an experience that <strong>works</strong> for devices that otherwise can&#8217;t access any web content right now. But there is great harm in not providing this experience: you must think of those not privileged enough to have 3G networks and smartphones all over. (Here I mean North America of course. :) )</p>

<p>I do not understand your last paragraph. You still didn&#8217;t answer the Gmail question, and still didn&#8217;t explain your cryptic criticism of Google search results before, and you&#8217;re telling the developing world that it doesn&#8217;t deserve any web until it can pony up for an iPhone. Yikes! I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s much point in continuing.</p>
