<p>Both <a href="http://dev.mobi">http://dev.mobi</a> and <a href="http://ready.mobi">http://ready.mobi</a> use thematic consistency to provide subject-equivalent (although style- and navigation-adapated) pages for a given <span class="caps">URL</span>. I believe I explained that when you flamed us before.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve been working hard (like the thousands of others who are trying to make this whole medium a reality) to be as <strong>inclusive</strong> as possible for multiple types of client. It&#8217;s a shame you don&#8217;t have anything positive to say on the matter.</p>

<p>For dotMobi&#8217;s sites, and our particular user type (developers) there&#8217;s little point in expending effort on WAP1.1 content for very legacy devices.</p>

<p>But in general terms, I can&#8217;t reconcile your blanket maxims &#8220;DEAD <span class="caps">BURIED</span>, <span class="caps">BYE</span> <span class="caps">WAP</span>&#8221; and &#8220;free of device discrimination&#8221;. Spare a thought for the billions on the planet who don&#8217;t yet own a mobile with an <span class="caps">HTML</span> browser.</p>

<p>What do you mean &#8220;Google doesn&#8217;t support <span class="caps">XHTML</span>&#8221;? The <span class="caps">URL</span> <a href="http://www.google.com/xhtml">http://www.google.com/xhtml</a> might give you pause for thought. Nevertheless I agree that <span class="caps">XHTML</span>&#8216;s future is not assured.</p>

<p>But the mobile web? Inevitable.</p>

<p>(Sadly, so are the challenges of device diversity, at least for the foresable future &#8211; but we&#8217;re not going to sit back and wait for that problem to go away before we begin the revolution. You&#8217;re welcome to, of course.)</p>
