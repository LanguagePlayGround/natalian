<p>i risk my life every day by riding a bike. last week my nightmare became true: i got into the tram tracks and got a contusion of my ribbs. i couldn&#8217;t breathe properly for a week. but i still hate public transport more than i hate being an invalid. (i should start wearing a helmet though)</p>
