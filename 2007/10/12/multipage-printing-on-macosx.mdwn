<p>I searched around for &#8220;multipage pages per sheet&#8221; for printing from my Darwin system and didn&#8217;t find what I was looking for.</p>

<p>Eventually I tracked the option down to the <strong>Layout</strong> section in the print dialog. Bump that up to 4 sheets per page and seriously start saving the world. ;)</p>
