<p>I used to think first direct was great.  In the past year I believe they&#8217;ve turned to crap.  First they clearly try to get rid of low-income customers.  Now they&#8217;re gouging any customer who exceeds their overdraft limit.</p>

<p>I left Nat West 15&#8211;20 years ago because I was so upset about the £30 they charged me twice for going overdrawn.  At least they wrote me a letter each time.  first direct wait until it&#8217;s time to send you your monthly statement before letting you know, but they charge you £25 (plus debit interest) for each day you exceed your overdraft limit.  (This is in the small print, they claim.)  The result is that in my latest monthly statement, I&#8217;ve got a £125 charge for the five days I exceeded my limit, plus £8 or so of debit interest.  Absolutely outrageous!!</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a decent online/telephone bank&#8212;you know, the type that first direct used to be?</p>
