<p>I don&#8217;t want to try encourage content authors to do anything. I think that is established fact, trying to get people to adhere to best practices is not going to work. I am encouraging the industry to embrace a new quality of browser, like Apple has done. That is Mobile 2.0!</p>

<p>Adaption as we already know is quite broken, to say the least. I think you are once again fighting a losing battle, by trying to get content adaptors to simply do the right thing. They do not have the right mindset.</p>

<p>I welcome debate. A balanced discussion. MM was largely about sales pitches and very one sided argumentation. Hence I was very frustrated. It would also be good if the debate was organised and I dare say short and to the point.</p>
