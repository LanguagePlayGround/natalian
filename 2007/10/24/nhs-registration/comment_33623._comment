<p>The passport is new to me, but the utility bill request is not. I think it&#8217;s just to prove to them that you should be registered with them rather than some other practise, which is obviously much less of a problem in rural areas as there is often only one practise. When I moved one mile (I just measured it) I was amazed that I had to change practises, and I had to provide a utility bill to show that I was indeed in their catchment area.</p>
