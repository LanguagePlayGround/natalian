<p>Don&#8217;t forget when registering for <span class="caps">VAT</span> that there is a scheme for first year companies that allows you to register to pay less <span class="caps">VAT</span>.</p>

<p>In essence you charge 17.5% on your sales, but only pay the tax man 13% &#8211; this is definitely worth doing, but unfortunately I&#8217;ve forgotten the name of the scheme.  It should be on the <span class="caps">HMRC</span> website.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve just finished closing down a company, and the one thing I learnt, and the one thing that has been <strong>really</strong> painful for me is &#8211; get an accountant. Seriously. They will save you more than they cost.</p>
